"Thank you all!","2022-07-17",1658099667,"Thank you all!","I DID IT!!!

After a turbulent few months I can officially say that after 157h 43m I have completed Elden Ring! (some many of these hours may or may not have been staring blankly at the screen after getting my behind handed to me for the 12883th time or googling the weaknesses of bosses but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do) 

I have collected all the great runes, done as many questlines as I could, catacombs, followed things you missed videos AND got the Age of Stars ending as a fromsoftware noob!!

Now I know that rumour has it Elden Ring may not have been as difficult as previous titles in the fromsoftware collection and I never thought I'd like a 'hard' game but honestly I was totally immersed in the lore, I felt so accomplished after beating difficult bosses and I am genuinely looking at other games like bloodbourne or sekiro as my next challenge (after new game + ofcourse!) but I just had to share with you guys how proud I am for managing this feat and becoming Elden Lord!

I also have a nack for finding secrets and hidden things and by god did this game have me itching to explore each and every area.. To then go back and find things I previously missed AND THEN watch a things you missed video and finding even more!

I guess I wanted to say thanks to you guys aswell for your words of wisdom, I may not be an active poster but trust me when I say your tips and tricks helped massively as I traversed through the game!! (also massive thanks to my hubby who spoon-fed me plenty info and spent many hours watching and rooting for me as I fought many foe and became Elden Lord!! 

Also if you recommend grabbing any particular item or doing anything before hitting new game+ please let me know as I will be spending a couple hours on cleanup before I go into the story all over again (thankfully with more understanding than the first time!)


Anyway, Tarnished.. Thank you for letting me brag, and making it this far in the post &amp; bring on the platinum!

"Question regarding the Age of Order","2022-07-17",1658100915,"Question regarding the Age of Order","So after getting every ending, I started to think about which one is best for the Lands Between. Initially I was under the impression the Age of the Stars was. Honestly, because it just looked really cool. But it doesnt really solve any of the Land Betweens problems. As I delved deeper into the lore though, my opinion on Ranni soured. Like in the end she started a lot of the problems in the game and plays chess master to get the outcome she desires. Fair I guess, not wanting to be a pawn to higher entities and all but she ends up making pawns in her own plan. 

It wasnt until I followed Goldmasks quest that it started to hit me, fundamentalism is the way. The pursuit of objective truth is the best route to start identifying problems within the status quo and the way to prevent said problems from recurring. The Mending Rune of Order is the key to stop the problems. Prevent the very gods from being able to intrude on the order with their selfish desires. Yet from what Ive gathered, people are under the impression that this only applies to demigods and not, actual outer gods like GW. 

I guess this is my question, isnt the fickleness of the gods just as applicable to the Greater Will as it is to Marika? The only true god we know in the story is Marika, and her fickleness shows in removing the rune of death giving her and her offspring eternal life. Yet the Greater Will shows to be fickle in its own right by having Marika wage war on anything that poses a threat to it.(Fire Giants, Dragons, Frenzied Flame worshippers) So if its applicable to both, then the Age of Order should be the best outcome shouldnt it?","Eldenring",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1kp9g/question_regarding_the_age_of_order/"

"Melina is a good example of what didn't work in Elden Ring's RPG narrative","2022-07-17",1658100315,"Melina is a good example of what didn't work in Elden Ring's RPG narrative","I wrote a comment on the ""Melina being a disappointment"" thread and it turned into a polemic on the role of all narrative in Elden Ring, so I thought I would give it its own post. TL;DR: Elden Ring didn't transfer the souls formula for narrative well nor did it do a good job at a conventional narrative, even despite having really strong foundations and cool ideas.

Even though I want FromSoft to follow their own artistic vision, I hope they and all the developers watching their success learn the right lessons from Elden Ring. Their commitment to immersive gameplay and exploration is top tier, but they dropped the ball hard on almost all of the narrative elements of Elden Ring.

During my first experience with the Dark Souls games the lore and story felt just fleshed out enough to be a compelling mystery, but sparse enough that I expected most of it to be left up to interpretation. Lore and story exposition was often a brief and pleasant surprise. In contrast, Elden Ring front-loads a LOT of lore, story and characterization in the early game. Later on, it works pretty much the same way as the Souls series, but now it's just a letdown because they set my expectations for something different.

Melina is the prime example of this. She gets a couple of very high quality introductory cutscenes and an interesting character arc hook: she's seeking her purpose and wants you to help her find it. You can explore for a bit before she shows up to help you and you're meant to believe that she and Torrent are your constant companions in your journey going forward. Because of this she starts out more impactful and endearing than any of the Souls maidens.

However after this she ends up being less present and less developed than any of those maidens besides Anastacia. Even that's arguable because Anastacia being gone *is a development*. Melina's absence is just confusing. I was convinced on my first playthrough that Melina not showing up at the bonfires when she's clearly capable meant she actually had no interest in me and was using me for an ulterior motive. Her later cutscenes don't point to that at all though. Her only purpose during the events of the game is to clear the way for you to become Elden Lord of a new age. On top of that, there's a point in the game where she *does* leave you temporarily, and you are probably meant to feel a little used. Her return is set up to be quite exciting. But it has absolutely no impact because she is not present either before or after this development. It was an annoyance more than anything because for a long time I couldn't round up all the Marika speeches in the churches. Melina's absence didn't help to characterize her, it only hurt the characterization process of another character. Brilliant.

Melina's best characterization comes from the Frenzied Flame ending. Even with that in mind I'd argue that Ranni is the most fleshed out character in the game with the most interesting ending. Regardless, if you're looking for interesting story and a climactic ending in your playthrough, then your options are acting against the interests of the character you're meant to have the closest relationship with from the beginning of the game (Melina) or helping the character who betrayed everybody and set the end of the world in motion and is not shy about using you for her ulterior motives (Ranni). A lot of players are not going to want to do either of those things. Fia's path of making the best out of the chaos Ranni wrought is the best alternative for many of those players, but its progression and ending are woefully underdeveloped, especially the ending. Millicent and Malenia's storyline was a perfect opportunity for ""something else entirely"" but I think even the story they tried to tell instead was blatantly unfinished.

A quick list of further narrative elements that didn't get satisfactory payoff:

* Godskins as a recurring, pervasive enemy
* D's twin
* Gideon, Seluvis, and Dolores
* albinaurics
* lore of the Two Fingers (this is probably very intentional though)
* all the people who swear fealty to your coming reign (especially Boc)
* Roderika's pre-roundtable storyline
* misbegotten and demi-humans lore
* Diallos never found out his brother died
* Godfrey has the opposite problem, many players don't understand how he came back
* Greyoll and the lesser dragons
* Lansseax
* Fire Giant (definitely intentional, but it doesn't work well when it's not an exception)
* Marika's betrayal of Maliketh
* Vyke
* Kale

I'll stop there for now, I'm sure there's a lot more I haven't thought of. Some of these items are pretty subjective, I'm aware. I'm also sure that at least a few items on this list are due to me not finding the right interactions or item descriptions, but we haven't even gotten into FromSoft's questing and item description systems not working in an open world.

A lot of these issues are a problem because From was too ambitious. It was probably unreasonable for them to fully develop all the ideas they had and it's unreasonable for us to expect them all to be perfect in the game we got. However Melina is one of the most important characters in the story and her involvement could have been significantly improved with very small changes. Just having her show up every time you level up would be huge. I'm a huge fan of the suggestion for her and Torrent to chill at the bonfires with you even without leveling up. If you're more ambitious you could provide her with more and more dialogue relating to parts of your journey. I think that would also make me much more excited about finding bonfires, something that has been lost since Dark Souls' formula of rare bonfires and no fast travel. And of course, I wish we had more information on who she really is. The fire keepers had a place and role in the world. So did our player characters, the Undead and the Ashen ones. Elden Ring starts out without much context for where the Tarnished come from but slowly reveals your origins to you. Melina seems to be set up for a similar process but it never comes. Her character doesn't succeed in providing you a feeling of companionship, it doesn't feel like a mirror journey to your own, it doesn't add context to the surrounding world nor does it get contextualized by anything in the world. It doesn't even provide narrative direction: with the exception of the Marika speeches, which could have been item descriptions or placards, you could remove her from the game entirely and lose no information whatsoever. Varre, Gideon and Enia are capable of providing all of the direction that Melina does. For fuck's sake she's not even responsible for finding you and giving you Torrent. According to her own words Torrent chooses you himself. Torrent could have been waiting for you by the First Steps grace or Renna could have given you the Spectral Steed Whistle. Melina's early role is to ""play the part of maiden"" but that idea is very underexplored anyways. Not a single NPC we meet has a living maiden, and it's very, very fuzzily implied we already had a maiden who was killed by the Bloody Fingers. Your finger maiden could have guided you to the Roundtable before being killed off, or any number of NPC's could have shown you the way there instead. The only thing Melina is needed for is burning the Erdtree. She could have been introduced at any point. Why is she so hyped up at the beginning of the game?

To conclude I should mention I don't hate this game, I do think it's incredible. I don't even think every single questline is garbage. I was impressed with the Volcano Manor questline and I think Alexander's fits into the game perfectly, exactly the way NPC quests did in the Souls games. Ranni's quest is fantastic of course. I'm frankly amazed at how many interesting NPC's there are in Elden Ring. After the patch that finished some endings not a single one besides Melina feels like a throwaway character. Even Yura and Gostoc, who had significant cuts from what they were originally intended to be, are well-performed characters who add to the world. You could argue the merchants don't have much going on but I think it was a great decision to merge them all into one faction. It's a bit like they're all one NPC, with their story coming from Kale and the Frenzied Flame quest. Souls games have had lots of NPCs who served no purpose but to be merchants, and the Nomad faction as a whole has more characterization than any one them. And of course, I think this is the best Souls game we've gotten yet in terms of gameplay. The shame is that we've lost another thing that made Dark Souls 1 so great, the gameplay IS the narrative, and we didn't get very good conventional narrative in replacement.","Eldenring",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1khw6/melina_is_a_good_example_of_what_didnt_work_in/"

"Margit/Morgott are Probably my Favorite Bosses in Soulsgames","2022-07-18",1658113766,"Margit/Morgott are Probably my Favorite Bosses in Soulsgames","So let me just start off by saying this.

Before Elden Ring I considered myself to be a slightly experienced Souls newbie. My first souls game was DS2 (3 had long been out but 2 was the only one my laptop could run, and I had heard bad things about  the DS remaster).

Well 2 was a... rough experience. I'm sure there are people that like it and that's great! But Personally it just didn't feel great for me for a variety of reasons that I don't want to get off topic dweelling on. Eventually I got a better computer and abandoned DS2 for DS3 and stopped playing (started a long break) after defeating Abyss Watchers.

But in my days of DS2 and 3 I kept some embarrisingly major bad habits. Panic Rolling during fights, Being scared of dying out of the curse thing and losing souls to a point where I had reset areas an insanely ridiculous number of times before finally making it out of the area, being absolutely TERRIBLE at PvP (mostly because of panic roll).

Despite getting a tiny bit better about panic rolling and being braver, souls games at the time just never felt meant to click for me. And so began my very long break from playing them after defeating abyss watchers (which was an absolutely amazing fight. Like I said not dissing on the games, just at the time felt too hard for me).

And then eventually Elden Ring came out.

Now, I was hesitant on buying the game, particularly for the reasons stated above on me being aweful at souls games. But, I was looking for a new RPG, my friends were all getting it, the world looked beautiful, reviewers gave the game all perfect scores, magic in this game looked PHENOMENAL (I always wanted to play a spellcaster but i stuck with knight in the DS games for armor and vigor).

So I bought the game the moment it launched, started as astrologer, fought tree sentinal horse guy at the beginning (mistakes were made), and eventually made it to a boss I had heard a lot about at the time.

Margitt the Fell Omen.

At the time, I absolutely hated the boss. I had tried, and tried, and tried, and tried over and over, for exaccty 3 hours straight. I used all of my spells, whatever summons I had, summoned Rogier every single time, only to die over and over and over again.

But little did I realize at the time Margit was erasing my every bad habit, and unironically being the perfect trainer. The delayed attacks made me have to pay attention to his timing, rather than guess rolling and panic rolling I truly relied on reflexes. Dying to him over and over again for 3 hours practically erased my fear of death and rune loss completely, I was never again afraid to try and try again untill success.

And boy was that success sweet.

After 3 long hours of abusing the HELL out of summons, I finally beat him, and it was such an amazing feeling.

Well time goes on, i get better/stronger and progress, and much to my surprise we meet again.

So began my battle with Morgott the Omen King.

And it was special to me really. When I first fought Margit, all I did was panic roll. When I fought woth Morgott, my dodges were perfectly timed (well, mostly lol). When I fought Margit, I absolutely abused my spirit summons and summoning Rogier. When I fought Morgott, I used 0 summons. When I fought Margit, it took me 3 hours.

When I fought Morgott, it took me 20 minutes.

After talking to him one last time, I just felt, amazing really. That moment in my defeating Morgott made me realize just how much better I had gotten, how far I had come since being told I had absolutely 0 maidens.

But really, the feeling was indescribable. And I will never forget my battle with Margit the Fell, and Morgott the Omen King.

Elden Ring has absolutely become my favorite game of all time. Still working on beating it, as I really just play whenever I have time and enough energy to focus, but man it has been one hell of a journey so far.


Just wanted to share my personal take. Sorry for the text wall but I appreciate you for taking the time to read about my experience. Absolutely going back to finish the Dark Souls games once I beat this game.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1oydh/margitmorgott_are_probably_my_favorite_bosses_in/"

Godfreys Icon states that when Godfrey vowed to become a lord, he took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back to suppress the ceaseless lust for battle that raged within. Took upon his back could mean that hes had Serosh piggy-backing for the last few ages as a portable therapist, or that he physically grafted Serosh onto his back to quell his fighting spirit.

Which brings me to Godrick the Grafted. Godrick comes from the Golden Lineage, which is Godfreys bloodline. The Remembrance of the Grafted states that Godrick, a feeble man sought power through the grotesque act of grafting. One day well return together, to our home, bathed in rays of gold. When the Tarnished is defeated by Godrick, he seems to be vying for the attention of the First Elden Lord, to impress him. Great Godfrey, didst thou witness? This all leads me to believe that Godrick has grafted himself  a bit too obsessively  to mirror Godfreys grafting of Serosh. Its not hard to believe that a disillusioned exile of the Golden Lineage started grafting because they thought it helped their relative attain the throne. And sure enough, even Godricks Battleaxe is emblazoned with the figure of a beast, representing the strength of Godfrey, First Elden Lord and patriarch of the golden lineage.

Which brings me back to Serosh. Serosh undoubtably became the symbol of the Golden Lineage, particularly a symbol of strength that descendants have since reached for as an ideal. Its ironic, because Seroshs purpose was to tame Godfrey, not make him stronger. The two are so intertwined that Serosh is killed when he is removed from Godfreys back, and once he is gone, it seems that open wounds are left in his place on the bloody back of Hoarah Loux (WAAAAAAARRIOOOOOOOR).

TL;DR Godfrey is grafted, and the Golden Lineage is full of desperate copycats.","Eldenring",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1msx8/is_godfrey_first_elden_lord_grafted/"

\- I met her at the Church near the start of the game.

\- I've defeated both Royal Knight Loretta and Starscourge Radahn but she never appears in Ranni's Rise. Saw people say it was because of Blaidd and the festival so I exhausted all of Blaidds dialog after the Radahn fight 

\- Even got to the treasure in Nokron just to be safe was told ""you are not destined to open this"" because the quest obviously hasn't started

\- Saw people say Rogier's quest can block it but there's no dialog for him, he's just sleeping

My favourite boss is definitely &gt;!Godfrey/Horah Loux!&lt; because of how much the boss changes up in its second phase. He could have maybe done with having a little more health but its otherwise an extremely satisfying boss and every death felt like it was my fault.

&gt;!Godrick!&lt; is a close second as he was one of the first souls bosses I really struggled to overcome and ive been chasing the high ever since.

My least favourite bosses are tied with &gt;!Rykard!&lt; and &gt;!Elden Beast!&lt;. The former because of my dislike of gimmick bosses and issues with the camera and the skull attacks completely obscuring the screen. And the latter for similar camera related reasons as well as the amount of time spent running across the arena just to do damage.

I think guard counters are rad but I also like 2handing my halberd, blocking with a weapon is pretty bad though because you take a decent chunk of damage still. I make it work by using the Dragon Crest Talismans and really increasing my physical damage absorption so blocking is more worth it, the curved sword talisman so Guard Counters are more worth it, but the biggest trick is to use the Assassins' Crimson Dagger Talisman so critical hits restore the damage I took by blocking.

"8","2022-07-18",1658125176,"Marias Executioner Sword Underwhelming","First off let me say that for the most part boss weapons tend to be really good. Lot of games when they give you boss weapons, they usually feel watered down toy copies. But in Elden Ring the devs did a really good job of making boss weapons feel really strong and still reflect the unique aspect of each boss. (Expect for a few.) With that said, it is in my opinion that the Marias Executioners Sword is underwhelming. 

The damage scaling is a bit odd with a decent chunk going to magic. This would be fine except that lots of enemies have resistances to magic. The weapon art itself is really good and fun if you build for it. But there are better options for dps that are way safer and more reliable than Eochiads Dancing Blade. Not to mention usually the final swing during the weapon will miss the target which is not great because of how much damage it does. As a side note I could be trippin but sometimes this sword will miss normal follow up attacks and feels pretty short for a great sword. 

This sword feels like one of those watered down boss weapons. I wish the devs gave you the ability to either throw out the drill as your heavy attack or throw out your sword like the bell bearing hunter does with a light attack. (As in heavy and light weapon art attacks) Its not like other weapons dont have 2 unique weapon art abilities. Example of this would be Death Poker or Sword of Night and Flame.

Even after all that I do love this sword and I am still going to use it, just seems like it could be better, not game-breaking, boss-breaking. Just a little better.

TL:DR 

Sword good, wish it had more weapon art abilities. Better swords available. Needs more viability imo.","Eldenring",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1s7sr/marias_executioner_sword_underwhelming/"

I already defeated Miquella and the Elden Beast and all I have left to do is choose an ending. I have the frenzied flame and wanted to undo it using the needle but I don't have the Unalloyed Gold Needle in my inventory. I read that I should get it back from Millicent but I can not find her anywhere. I did fight the Ulcerated Tree Spirit near the Drainage Channel site of grace and for the life of me I can't recall going back there to choose to help her even though I knew I should have. As evidence of that I see I don't have the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia talisman in my inventory. 

So I guess I have to move to ng+ at this point to see other endings, right? Wanted to ask here maybe I'm missing something just in case, before I chose the ending I'm locked to.

I found her at the mountain top of giants at the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins site of grave *facepalm* I feel like such a moron but oh man am I glad.

The game was feeling so good and so complete. I can't imagine game like this since The Witcher 3, game that take over your life and your mind. With so much 'gameplay' outside a game, gaining all talismans/ashes, reading wiki, planning the best bulid. 

During my gameplay I have finished all quests from every NPC and unlocked all endings to have all my posibilities open for me. So after using needle to get rid of Frenzied Flame locked ending I have chosed Rani ending as the most lore complete for my character and my gameplay. 

After 3 minutes it was over. 

And I was like... Em... Ok? So that's it? 
So maybe I chose poorly. I went to YouTube to check other endings.

The Frenzied Flame I select as the second one of my desire, was even more poor as the star ending. The animation of fire head and cool looking (but semi static) eruption of Volcano Manor and that's it. 

Next I wonder about Dung Eater, and this one feels really ok, I have felt sad about the future of The Lands Between. The narration was ok, and history feels ended. But then I have find out that all the rest of endings was exactly the same, with a few exeptions of collors and words. What a shame! Do you know what it was? It was endings of vanilla Mass Effect 3, where You had different colours at the end...

I was so suprised. The game, masterpiece which take me to the trip for almost 300 hours was ended so poor, feels like done on scratch, about a day till the deadline for releasing of Elden Ring. An real 'Cyberpunked' ending. 

Is it the ultimate, last, mega-chad slap in the face from the creators of ER? The feeling I have right now... Is it the touch from one and only Miyazaki-senpai? The secret one finger ending?

The main road is leading you there anyways, but if you deviate from the road and stumble upon a sending gate, your flow of discovery is thrown out of wack. 

You either take the sending gate and have to back track to find Patches, Prawn Lad, and Rya or you skip the sending gate.

"65","2022-07-18",1658118689,"Crystalians as a Sorceror?","I'm currently playing a sorcery build, and I'm running into a wall when it comes to the Twin Crystalians in the Academy Tunnel. I've been following along with a number of guides which all have slightly different routes, but all basically follow the same theme;

1. Pick up the Morning Star/Katana/other applicable bleed weapon and a Gold Fowl Foot.
2. Go to Caelid and kill the big mama dragon for the \~100k runes, then grab the Medallion piece.
3. level up INT to 40 and Mind to 20.
4. Grab the Meteorite Staff and Rock Fling from the swamp.
5. Loot the town of Sellia and kill the bosses for Lusat's Staff.
6. Grab the other Medallion piece from Fort Haight, along with as many Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears as you can find.
7. Skip past Stormveil, and run up through Liurnia until you hit the Great Lift. 
8. Run through Altus and Mt Germir until you find Master Azur, and get the Azur Comet spell.
9. Go to the Tree Spirit and kill it for the infinite mana Tear.

One of the differences in all of these guides, is when they say to kill the Crystalians and get the Terra Magicka spell; some say to stop by and do it while running through Liurnia, some say to do it after you've done everything else. But as far as I can tell, from the videos I've seen the only difference is that doing it after means you might have more flasks. And by sheer coincidence, I'm sure, every single mage guide just skips over killing the Crystalians, like it's the easiest thing in the world for a basically INT only caster to do. 

I'm getting my butt handed to me over and over. I don't have the health to tank their hits, I don't have the vigor to wear heavier armor to mitigate their hits, I don't have enough strength to break their armor before they can kill me, and none of my summons are strong enough to keep aggro without also dying immediately. Is there any real solution to this beyond just coming back after I'm level 200 with  40 VIT, Azur's set, a +10 Mimic Tear and just infinite Comet them into dust?","Eldenring",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1qfbk/crystalians_as_a_sorceror/"

This is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, ""newbie"" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.

Well written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just dont like. This includes so and so boss is stupid and too difficult.

If you are interested in the game but dont own it yet, please dont post should I buy this game? or Is this game worth it?. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you havent, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And thats okay!

Lastly, be friendly! We are all here because we are interested in the same game! Please treat your fellow players with respect.

"91","2022-07-18",1658115242,"What connects the Flame of Frenzy to Gravity magic?","In the Ailing Village, a shield depicting the yellow flame of frenzy can be found on the body of an Alabaster Lord. These stone-skinned Lords use and teach gravity magic and were said to have gained life when a meteor crashed into stone. 

The Yelough (Yellow) Anix Tunnel can be found just south of the Yelough Anix Ruins, where all who dwell are followers of the Chaos Flame. However, that tunnel is filled with gravity manipulating Alabaster Lords and even Astel, Stars of Darkness. 

Neither the Alabaster (white) or Onyx (black) Lords ever actually use any incantations themselves, and obviously they are strongly associated with intelligence, so why or how would they be associated with the religious fanatics of The Three Fingers? 

All I can think of is that they turned to madness after being discriminated against for heresy against House Caria or The Erdtree, but basically every faction in Elden Ring is discriminated against by the existing order, so that doesn't explain why they'd turn to madness rather than just join the Haligtree or literally any other faction which opposes the Erdtree.","Eldenring",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1peln/what_connects_the_flame_of_frenzy_to_gravity_magic/"

"I hate the Waterfowl Dance with every fiber of my being.","2022-07-18",1658145549,"I hate the Waterfowl Dance with every fiber of my being.","It seriously ruined (for me) one of the coolest boss fights in the game. After all the horror stories I've read online, I was actually really hyped to see that it would be a straight up duel where, for once, I was allowed to dictate the pace. I had a lot of fun poking at her with my sword, dodging her attacks and overall just trying to keep the pressure up. It felt so satisfying that I didn't even use magic or my shield and instead decided to give her a fair fight by two-handing my stitcher. And then, she used that unholy move and I just couldn't look at that fight the same way. I fought her rather aggressively before, constantly trying to engage and knowing that if I mess up, she's not only gonna deal a lot of damage to me, but she's also gonna heal in the process, so I would be doubly punished for any mistakes. A challenging, but also a fair, fun and engaging system. But after discovering that she can pretty much nuke me if I'm doing anything other than sprinting when she winds up that attack, this fight became a slog. It went from constantly engaging her to trying to bait out her attack and get some damage in if it wasn't waterfowl. This shit annoyed me so much that I genuinely changed my entire build and went from heavy thrusting sword + magic to prelate's charge great stars and literally bullied my way to victory over the rotten bitch with help from my mimic. I'm seriously surprised how only one move can turn an amazing fight into one where I'm scared to do anything riskier because the boss might just decide to cut my ass into hundreds of little pieces without giving me enough time to try and avoid it.","Eldenring",21,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1xjmw/i_hate_the_waterfowl_dance_with_every_fiber_of_my/"

"To my surprise: Using Guard Counter and Spirit Ashes made the game WAY more fun for me.","2022-07-18",1658140761,"To my surprise: Using Guard Counter and Spirit Ashes made the game WAY more fun for me.","I will like to ask you some questions:

\-If you were a souls fan at the point of playing Sekiro for the first time, did you at some point had a moment were you thought ""ooooh im supposed to block instead of dashing""?

\-If you didn't play any souls game before playing Sekiro, did that also happened to you?

Im going to assume (for the sake of my argument, basically, this is not a poll after all), that the answers were, for the most part YES for the 1st, and NO for the 2nd.

I had that moment in my **second** playthrough of Elden Ring, using some mechanics that answered lots of the questions I had with the game. If you want to know more about what a random dude on the internet thinks about this, take your time to read (but first, let me apologize for my basic level of english).

\-

I've been playing Souls games since Demon's Souls, at some point in the franchise I decided to stop blocking and started rolling in order to avoid attacks, (except for sekiro, of course) and I never summoned before. **I have the feeling** that what I mentioned is seeing **in general** as the way to play, yes, some of us use shields, some of us summons. But the ""rolling meme"" and people breaking controllers clips are there for a reason.

So when Elden Ring came out, I just did that, I took the ""Open world Dark Souls 4"" approach, and it was fun, for the most part. But something was weird, like something was missing.

What I was missing were mechanics that I now think are essential to Elden Ring: Shield Guard, the joy of summoning spirit ashes and the fun of playing with different tools that the game offers. All of that let me thinking for a while...

We all know how both Bloodborne and Sekiro changed the way we look at how Souls can be played. (well I don't consider Sekiro a souls, actually. But, you know...) BB forced Shield users to dash in order to avoid damage, while Sekiro forced Rolling users to block at the right time.  Lots of us feel naked at the time playing BB for the first time without a shield, and lots of us suffered until we had the ""aha!"" moment in Sekiro. 

After all these months playing and watching many people play, I realize how many frustrations the people that were playing like me had, while the ones taking advantage of those mechanics were having a totally different experience. 

Reading what Critics, Reviewers, Fans and Newcomers have to say about the game, made me realize how different people tend to approach Souls and how different the experience can be. Again: this is based on what I read from others and my own experience, nothing scientific about it and it will not represent everyone. 

So I decided to do a second run from the start and take advantage of things that I was avoiding because *it is not the way I play* **Souls*****.*** I had such a good time! it was fun to learn when to use shield guard or when to just do a regular or heavy attack, bosses gives time to do so. And the Spirit Ashes also creates new openings to attack aswell. I was finally playing **Elden Ring.** 

It is way, way WAY more fun. Yes, some bosses were easier, some were more difficult, actually. I remember rolling my eyes everytime the game gave me a summoning upgrading material as a reward, now I feel like getting a new bigger titanite in past Souls. The amount of creative things we can do with the things that the game offers us to do with different summons, like placing Latenna at the border of the arena to be a turret while you fight the boss, creating different potions to drink according to the boss, breaking the guard of a boss with a shield guard attack. Changing equipment on the go to have a complementary Mimic Tear, etc...

Im happy to finally have my ""aha!"" moment in Elden Ring, but feel sorry that it happened after hundreds of hours. This is more or less what I was trying to say, it changes a lot when you accidentally close the tab at the point of finishing the post. :/

Anyway, if you think otherwise, give it a try, it might surprise you like it did to me. 

what do you think about all this? im allways up for a friendly conversation.

It's always just NPCs talking to a quiet player character. Like isn't that weird? You almost never see NPCs actually interacting with the world they're in. They just stand there doing nothing.

"Ancient dragon smithing stone is worse than sombre ancient dragon smithing stone.","2022-07-18",1658139722,"Ancient dragon smithing stone is worse than sombre ancient dragon smithing stone.","Sombre stones all give equal upgrades to damage. The gain for going from +8 to +9 is the same as from +9 to +10. So 1/10 of the upgrade capacity is behind limited resource.

But regular smithing stone upgrades have the same gain from +24 to +25 and +23 to +24. So only 1/25 of the upgrade is behind limited resource. I did check if this is true, not just a guess.

This means that +24 armaments are more upgraded than +9 sombre/special armaments.

An other think, I don't like is that I can't buy unlimited ancient dragon stones at the endgame. Because I have a high level hybrid build that can use every weapon. So I have 2 or more copies of every weapon in the game. But very few are upgraded past +9/+24.

Maybe it's contenders to be the Elden Lord? With the Player and Hoarah Loux specifically that would make sense, but Goldmask and Fia are useless in most combat and Dung Eater and Ofnir have resigned themself to mostly ignoring the quest for the throne.

Greetings fellow gamers, I was thinking of fighting Malenia for first time in either Ng+ or Ng+2. I want the boss fight to be super hard so that's why as she is one of those optional bosses who are supposed to be a big challenge. Currently I am in base Ng(Mount Gelmir).

In previous games for example I faced DS3's Nameless King for first time in either NG+ or NG+2. I beat DS3's Dlcs in ng+3.

I faced BB dlc's first boss for the first time in Ng+(this boss had high Ng+ scaling and he destroyed my character, i had to face him in base ng to beat him, then i came back ng+ and beat him).

I faced DSR's DLC on Ng+

I have a question, is Malenia scaled highly in Ng+ or Ng+2? Or is she about the same as she was in base Ng? Because different bosses have different scaling.","Eldenring",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1uv7o/opinion_on_when_to_do_malenia/"

Im currently playing alot with fire incantations and love vykes warspear.
But for some situations i just need another weapon to complement the spear. 
I really like the magma blades, but they just dont look good imo
I also tried to use the firegiant whip but outside of the AOW i am not really liking it.
At the moment i am at:
16str
20dex

And if possible with a fire AOW.

I am rather looking for a pvp weapon

Right now I've been using a bloody wakizashi with a keen uchigatana that I buff with bloodflame blade and go to town with. Its been working pretty well with high blood damage and pretty high base damage from my keen uchigatana. I just got another blood ash of war so I have been debating whether or not to apply it to my uchigatana to boost blood damage even further. But I'm not sure it will actually be a good idea. Because my uchigatana will no longer be buffable with blood flame blade I will be missing out on the extra fire damage and the extra blood proccing I think it \*might\* be a downgrade if I am understanding the math correctly. Right now, with current stats, making my uchigatana bloody would take the blade damage from 45 to 64. But bloodflame blade applies 40 blood damage over time that can be stacked. So if I understand how this works correctly, I'm effectively just adding 40 extra blood damage with bloodflame blade, it just isn't applied instantly. So it would take my blood damage on my uchigatana from 45 to 85. Add to this the fact that by making my uchigatana bloody instead of keen I am decreasing it's base damage (and losing out on the added fire damage from bloodflame blade) it doesn't really seem worth it until my stats are better and I am outclassing the benefit from bloodflame blade.

After exiting the other player's world, the game put me at the base of the elevator, with no lever to call it back down. And the game didn't register / save the fact that I touched the site of grace up there, so no fast travel up.

So now I'm locked out of the content up there...

"271","2022-07-18",1658154665,"Finished the game (twice), here is my opinion about it","Bought the game on release, with that in mind, it took me 3 months to complete it cause i could play for 2 hours per week, now i had the time to make a full complete playthrought. So after finishing the game, i can say that this one wasn't FromSoft's best try. I will try my best to explain why i personally don't think that Elden Ring was that good FS game compared to their other games

1. The open world. I was totally impressed by the open world in the beginning of the game. When i set my foot at Limgrave i was like ""my god this looks amazing, time to have some fun"". But as soon as i left Limgrave (including stormvile) i lost my interest in open world. The thing is that the other areas weren't as good. The problem was simple : many wide open areas with a lot of reused stuff. I arrived at Liurnia of the Lakes and all i saw was a big lake (what a surprise) but it was really dull. I mean, i was running around to explore and i found some interesting caves and ruins but it wasn't something impressive. I mostly got lost because everything started looking the same so i just used the map to arrive at the Academy which was a really well designed place. After finishing there i reached Caelid which was really well designed (vision wise) to show us how Malenia destroyed everything, MtotG was actually meh and let down, Farum Azula was amazing, Miquellas haligtree was good and pretty much every area was good looking. What really killed me in the open world was the copy pasted assets. The catacombs are exactly the same, the ruins are the same, the caves are the same, same rock design everywhere, it made me get bored pretty quickly. I was looking here and there just to see the same architect everywhere which made me getting bored pretty easily. The art direction was the best i've seen in video games but after sometime it started feeling the same thing over and over. I could excuse it in games that were supposed to simulate real world (gta, rdr2) but in a fantasy game it ruined the immersion in my perspective.
2. Exploration and mobs: These 2 are combined, and i ll be honest, when it comes to normal enemies, this game is the worst in the series. They are literally copy pasted (Godrick's soldiers are in late game too with different colour, commoners, most knights are the same everywhere with the same attack pattern, dogs and rats infesting the place, uninteresting enemies like the big blobs that can poison you, these fat dudes with the swords you find at Atlus and later at catacombs etc.). This  game reuses so many mobs later that i got to the point of thinking ""they just took the map and placed enemies randomly by just buffing their hp"". It reminded me when i was messing with world editor in Warcraft 3 and i was just spawning 10 same enemies everywhere (when i was 10-11 years old). It got boring because after sometime i just refused to fight most enemies and simple started run past every mob which, again, killed the exploration. This may sounds weird but in a game where, in later areas, i fight the same guy i fought in the beginning area with more hp, it just doesn't make me wanna fight it again. It isn't as bad as Ni Ohs enemy design, but it isn't good either for the scale of the game.Also,  a game so huge is supposed to make  you explore and discover stuff. When it comes to mobs rune drops, they give very few runes (i remember spending like 30 minutes to kill crucible knight in the beginning just to give me 2100 runes!) or the double crucible knight fight that gives you their armor set (WHY DON'T YOU JUST DROP THE ARMOR EARLIER! you kill like 100 of these dudes before and you need to kill them both for their armor?!) which is a bit under-rewarding. I found myself most of the time especially in late game wondering if exploring the X ruins was actually worth it which again, combined with the reused enemies, made me not wanting to explore many areas of the game. The smithing stones are also a little hard to find earlier without proper guides which makes it hard for new players to realise what the hell they are doing wrong and deal no damage which forces you to explore around to find them. Thing is, that this game forces exploration too much. Even items that you need to move on to the game are actually scattered around the world which means you MUST explore everything in order to find them if you don't want to use guides, which is insane cause many people who work like 8 hours a day can't spend that much time just to explore caves and ruins that are identical. This is really so god damn time consuming, i can't remember a previous souls title that put mandatory items into optional areas just to finish the game (i am not talking about starting DLCs).

Quests and NPCS: Not gonna talk a lot about this one because i found it completely insane that i had to search an entire area because the NPC told me ""some bandits stole this thing and they are down the way"" in a huge open world game. And don't get me started on the whole ""handholding"". It has to do with time consuming. If  you need like 10+ hours to finish an entire area with the quests that are so vague, well, it's better not even do them. While some of them were pretty awesome (like Ranni's quest) i did them by using guides because i couldn't spend an entire hour searching for vague statements of the NPCs. Speaking of NPCs, i hated how they didn't even animate them to move or even sync their mouth with that they say. It killed the immersion for me and i wouldn't say it is bad, but it is 2022 game, and this could be done years ago in older games, so i don't think it was THAT hard to animate them. Also i don't like how the whole world moves around you instead moving with you. You must go to the castle morne and meet irina's father in order for the quest to occur? Yeah i know that it is the same in AC games or some other open world games, but nothing happens in this world by itself, you MUST do the X thing in order for the Y thing to happen. It's not like RDR2 for example where some people are building a house and you can spend 20 hours into the game, come back without progressing throught the story and the house is built. I wouldn't mind it but i was expecting something more creative from FS. But since i know how FS works, i can't say that it was that bad. Just a minor nitpick by me.

Builds : the game shines here, 10/10, lots of builds to do, nothing to say here

Bosses : My biggest complain with this game are the boss fights. Not only most of them are designed badly, they are also copy pasted (100 tree sentinels, reusing 2 of the best boss fights in the game for no reason, 100 dragonic tree sentinels, these erdtree spirits etc). To start with, the beginning bosses were actually good, tree sentinel, margit, godrick were amazing bosses. When i first fought Margit i noticed that most of his attacks are delayed to a frustrating point. My first thoughts were like ""ok the boss is slow, so maybe this is why"". But the more i progressed, the more i realised that 99% of the bosses have delayed attacks. Now,  you may claim ""so what, it is a good way for old souls players to enjoy the challenge because  they got gud"". The thing is, they wouldn't git gud if the game was designed  with the same philosophy as the other games. Even people that could streamroll throught DS3 found Gael and Friede hard bosses, not because they had 100 delayed attacks, but because they had complicated attacks. Same goes for Fume Knight and Alonne, same goes for Artorias and Manus. These bosses were good, played at normal speed (a little faster than you but in the same pace of the game) and the fights were like dances. In elden ring however, the bosses are playing a completely different game most of the times and you need to pray to RNG god ""please, make the boss not to use the 10 hit combo with 8 delayed attacks and the 2 fast attacks that can stunlock me and kill me because my iframes aren't enough"". Basically, it is like playing DS2 without ADP. All the attacks can be dodged but the dodge needs to be 100% on point otherwise you will get hit and mostly hit again due to the chain attacks  the bosses have (Malenia's 3 slash attack, Radahn 360 no scope). Also i don't like how the bosses had always an answer for everything. Gap closing, gap opening, 360 attacks, delayed attacks, aoe attacks, insane chain attacks, huge damage, huge hp bar, reacting to drinking  estus, mid range attacks, ranged attacks, insane tracking etc. It felt like they took the AI from the red phantom outside executioner's chariot in DS2 and gave him the delay attacks of Blue Smelter demon in different forms. Most of the bosses felt like that. The issue was much worse when the boss decided  to abuse the RNG in order to kill you. Radahn is a very good example of this. He can summon these orbs that you either need to ride your horse or hide behind the hill to dodge them. Then he can randomly use his starcaller cry which makes  you get damaged because the horse gives no iframes and makes  you getting damaged anyway. And if you hide behind the hill, you won't see Radahn and you can easily get one shot by a random attack. Malenia does the same with the Wateflow attack which becomes next to impossible to dodge if she decides to use in front of you. Or Godfrey with his massive AOE attack that can pull out in random  times, or Radagon's teleport in your face, or Elden Beast summoning the elden stars that can track you forever while it spams huge slashes from a distance (speaking of which, this guy can completely negate the holy damage so if you are running holy build you are screwed in this fight). Also most bosses in second half are probably scaled on ng+ because before MtotG my damage was fine and after i got there my weapons could barely scratch the bosses. I had a feeling that i coudn't control these fights, i can't describe it. Everything happened just for the shake of happening, one shots, rng attacks and combos, huge health bars and insane speed (it took them some patches to realise that UGS are too slow and had to give them a speed buff)... I seriously thought that the game was bugged or something. Let's not speak about the boss quality because if i had to make a list ""top 10 FS games bosses"" the only boss that would maybe made it in the list would be Margit because it was one of the few fights i won because i got gud and not because the RNG outer god helped me. Gank fights were just bad and lame ""throw 2 bosses there and call it a day"" without a single try to balance the fight and make it fun like OaS or Darklurker or Demon Prince or Friede. Bosses like Godskin duo, two Gargoyles, two crucible Knights and many more are literally bland and i have no idea how they got approved. Dungeons, catacombs and ruins bosses were either an NPC acting like a boss or a reused boss in gang fight or a normal enemy with boss hp. But wait, the game gives you spirit ashes to make the fights more managable. Thing is that the ashes are either useless or insanely strong (mimic) so y ou can just relax back and watch your summon obliterating the boss while you are drinking coffee. So you end up in a situation where the boss will be either too difficult or too easy, without the in between.

"311","2022-07-18",1658154049,"Theory: Whatever killed Gransax also killed most of Leyndell","(I'll put a TL;DR at the end if it ends up being too long)

Okay, so ever since launch I've wondered about the state of Leyndell and Gransax himself, and the recent (amazing) art posted on the sub kind of sparked that again, so it got me thinking. To prelude those thoughts, here some context:

By the time we get to Leyndell, most of the city is dead, inhabited mostly by corpses littering the streets and building. Now, what killed those people? The Shattering, the war, should be the most obvious answer, right? Except there's a hole in that idea: The city walls never got breached. The one, and only time the walls of Leyndell fell, was when Gransax, the Ancient Dragon, attacked the city (as said in the Bolt of Gransax description). The city lived through a siege during the Shattering, as seen in the cinematic trailer, but they held. The walls never broke.

&amp;#x200B;

[The walls themselves are surpisingly intact](https://preview.redd.it/9u8c4szj0cc91.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5460aa2e8405b867ee5c4e7e3760a08fb91ce1d3)

So if the war never reached the inside of Leyndell, what killed the people inside? Why are there so many corpses all over the city? I think the answer lies within the corpses themselves. See, most of them are just your regular commoners, cowering on the ground or lying dead against a wall. But not all of them. A surprising amount of the commoners did not die ""normally"". They're not on the ground like any corpse we see.

They died standing. Hunched, face against the walls, or crouching, covering their faces, maybe in terror, or pain. It's like they tried to hide their face from something, and then got.... turned to stone, petrified, frozen for ever in that position.

&amp;#x200B;

[Commoners feel like they got frozen in place](https://preview.redd.it/de8gei381cc91.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fd448635cf3870a6ab033e2802a00ed3b763048)

Now we could assume ""maybe some attack went over the walls and poisoned or killed these people"", but the city, except for the buildings and walls crushed by Gransax and the surprising amount of ash covering the streets for a city pretty much untouched by the war, is pretty intact overall. No big craters in the walls like we see in Stormveil, or giant poison spears like the ones that Leyndell used against the siege.

And in addition to that, let's not forget the major element of that theory: there is, yet, another character killed, frozen in place, forever standing still in his last position, head roaring towards the sky: Gransax

&amp;#x200B;

[Gransax died roaring towards the sky, frozen in place](https://preview.redd.it/5v7xordv1cc91.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=425337976f15dfc8085cdc1332ddb78e7e8e7ac1)

We don't know what killed Gransax. We only know that he appeared over the city, broke the inner walls, and then.... died, without doing too much damage overall. And what a weird death it is. I can't help but compare the position of his corpse to the position of so many inhabitants. Unnatural positions, not a position a creature would just die in.

To this day, despite the claim of Leyndell still holding strong, the damage done by Gransax was never fixed. Like the city died a long time ago, despite the appearances.

They never got rid of the body and repaired the city, despite the attack presumably happening ages ago, so it would make sense that the corpses would stay in place too. As to what killed Gransax himself, I'm unsure. A tinfoil hat theory would be that Marika did it, turning Gransax into stone, the inhabitants, and herself in the process, as we don't know why she's all crumbly despite being ""The Eternal"", but it stands on nothing except for that stone parallel.

***TL;DR: So here's the theory***: ***When Gransax attacked, Leyndell deployed a weapon, could be a perfumer trick, could be some powerful incantation, but that weapon, despite being able to petrify Gransax, ended up doing the same to most of the population too. It would explain the sorry state of the city, the weird corpses all over it, and also why it's the only place we see it; it was so dangerous that they never dared use it again.***

There are no item description hinting towards any of this because except for the Bolt of Gransax, we have nothing related to his death, or the state of the city. All this is based on environmental storytelling.

"621","2022-07-18",1658150333,"Lore conspiracy time","So one of the things that intrigued me the first time I played the game was, why does the Black Knife assassins turn against Ranni, killing her associates and probably attempting to kill her too if she was around Three Sisters at the time. After all, they supposedly assisted her on her plot by stealing the fragment of the Rune of Death and murdering Godwyn. So they should be her allies, right? I read a bunch of theories about it, some people even arguing that Ranni betrayed Blaidd and Iji, and she was the one who sent the assassins after them, which I think is bollocks and makes no sense.

Instead, my theory is crafted based on a bunch of other theories. And goes a bit like this: What if the Black Knife assassins never worked for Ranni in the first place? Marika is the only person actually associated with the Black Knife assassins, since they were also Numen, and supposedly shared close bonds with her. So Marika was the one who plotted against Godwyn, which I know is not the crazy part, a lot of people already presumed this, but the twist comes a bit later. I think Marika was testing the limits of the Order, maybe because she started regretting sealing the Rune of Death. Let's remember that Marika is kind of a crazy bitch, she pretty much used Godfrey to get rid of all the competition and then banished him, so she killing her own child wouldn't be so far fetched. But here is the twist, what if Ranni found out about this plot, and then took advantage of it, by stealing a fragment of the fragment of the Rune of Death from the Black Knife assassins themselves? Because it's not explained how Ranni stole the Rune, and I find difficult for her to steal it directly from Maliketh, it would be way easier if she stole it after it was already out of his claws, by capturing Tiche and stealing from her. Which would then explain why the Black Knife assassins go after Ranni. But why just now and not back then? Because her fate is resumed, her fate could not move while Radahn held the stars captive, not for the better or for the worse. In other words, **Radahn was actually helping his little sister,** willingly or not, by holding her fate until the right moment came. So when things were set in motion again the assassins were finally able to retaliate her theft.

It's all crazy theories, but I think this explains a lot of stuff that otherwise wouldn't make much sense, what do you guys think?","Eldenring",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1z6nz/lore_conspiracy_time/"

"711","2022-07-18",1658149785,"OPINION: Elden Ring's most underrated Feature: Ashes of War","From a Game Design Perspective, RPGs always had a particular problem: You start with a level one crap sword, find the next best thing, and discard it. Then you find another next best thing and discard the former. Till you find the all-powerful-chosen-one-prophecy-sword-of-light-and-gods and that's it. No reason to return back to using any of the lower-tier weapons, keep using the one with the higher numbers.

BOTW tried solving this problem by making everything breakable  (with the exception of the Master Sword), but something about that system really irked a lot of players. Why waste time looking for the next powerful weapon when it breaks like a twig after use?

*Ashes of War* is by far the best design answer to this conundrum. Now the level one crap sword has something the all-powerful sword doesn't: **Customization**. All of Elden Ring's Unique weapons have potent abilities, yes...but you can't swap them out, or change their scaling to suit your build/playstyle.

I always felt annoyed I couldn't change the Skills on Unique Weapons, but I realized that's in place so I can try out something different with the ""less powerful"" weapons. I can experiment with them. They still have some use even when I find something more ""powerful""

Plus it adds a new tangible resource/reward in-game. Something to look forward to when exploring or going into dungeons or killing that mini-boss.","Eldenring",595,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1yzl2/opinion_elden_rings_most_underrated_feature_ashes/"

One thing I've been wondering though. What exactly happens at the start of the game? You see the other Tarnished rise from their graves as they're touched by a tiny bit of grace. Then you see what looks to me like the inside of the Erdtree, and your player character awakening, and passing through to the Chapel of Anticipation. Where you're awaited by a minion of Godrick.

So, why do you awaken there? Is that where all Tarnished enter the Lands Between? Or was your corpse buried in that chapel? If so, does that mean your player character was part of the Stormhawk King's court in their past life?

Also, what exactly is and isn't a Tarnished? I mean, I get that they're no longer graced by the tree, and can't return there on death. And that's sorta why you come back from the dead every time Malenia kicks your ass again. But, are all the other npc's you talk to Tarnished as well? I know the traveling merchants aren't. But besides them, are there still normal, graced humans left in this world who aren't mindless zombies? What is the state of the world outside of the Lands Between? Is everywhere as dead and monster infested as here?

Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal but since the recent change that bell bearings carry over to NG+ its not that great anymore. Any help would be appreciated.

I personally dont think Spirit Summons trivialize certain bosses or at least not to the extent players make it out to be(unless its mimic tear, but even then you need a very strong build). Do they make it easier? Most definitely I 100% agree. Do they make a large majority of the main bosses a walk in the park? Honestly not at all, in my experience I was still getting destroyed by guys like Maliketh and Melania even with having a pretty strong build. I definitely do agree that there are a bunch of bosses that definitely have unfair moves/combos, timing, etc that make it very hard to beat them 1-on-1.

But even then there was still that great feeling of euphoria from beating them and not a sense of yeah not playing this again.

"Malenia and Miquella Origin Theory(Long Post)","2022-07-18",1658177278,"Malenia and Miquella Origin Theory(Long Post)","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7uy33ll41ec91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b7aae1328adc05e0bcfaabfab11df721f919e6

 This is my first post on the Reddit in a lore capacity and it's going to be a long one.   


  Ever since I read item descriptions about Malenia and Miquella's origins, I've had some lingering doubts about this narrative.  We are told that the twin prodigies were born of one God, and for this reason they were both empyreans, yet were frail and born with afflictions.  This sounds well and good, but why are these afflictions associated with Outer Gods?  It seems pretty random that the sealed God of Rot would just choose Malenia.  We also don't see this happen with other demigods.  These sorts of curses and afflictions in Souls games usually have some kind of reason or precedent, but we are given none in this case.      
 

 If Radagon was at some point a different person, then that means the twin prodigies were not born from a single God.  If Radagon was always a part of Marika, which I believe, then that means Marika was able to make children on her own.  If Marika was capable of Parthenogenesis(The ability to produce offspring without a mate), then why did she need a consort before?  There seems to be this need to Gods to require consorts in order to reproduce, as we in Mohg and Miquella's situation.  Parthenogenesis is very rare in this game and it only happens to apply to the two characters who are also highly associated with other Gods, the God of Rot for Malenia, and St. Trina for Miquella.      


  In Elden Ring, characters who are direct offspring tend to take after their parents.  This is a pretty consistent theme, so it makes Malenia and Miquella's situations more anomalous.   
 

https://preview.redd.it/lh7kia8f1ec91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50c2d8d133f2c64c30c130f82dd70034ec16e259

 First, we are told Malenia and her Crimson Valkyrie offspring are 'Afflicted' with scarlet rot, and it does seem to inconvenience them.  Yet the rot is also a source of strength.  When Malenia blooms in her bossfight, she becomes much more powerful.  When armed with unnalloyed prosthetics, a Crimson Valkyrie is more than a match for most demigods.  I think it is more reasonable to say that Malenia and the Crimson Valkyries are a distinct type of humanoid in the Lands Between.  The rot is essential to their nature, it is not an affliction in the same way that scarlet rot afflicts the player.   
 

 Second, there is no stated reason why the sealed God of Rot would just choose Malenia to be its vessel.  Was there some relationship between Radagon and the God of Rot? Was there some kind of Grudge between them?  We know very little of Radagon before he met Rennala.      
  

We do know he left her with an amber egg used in the forbidden art of reincarnation.   
  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/j3nh9hql1ec91.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=190574ba7e1153c6b3bffc55fe196735fbc70146)

Usually, when people talk about the egg, they bring it up in relation to Ranni.  It's true that when we meet Rennala, she is trying to create clones of Ranni because she cannot get over the loss of her daughter.  Judging by the way we use it in game, the egg cannot be used to birth new organisms, but can be used to rebirth them.  The egg has a Great Rune inside called the Great Rune of Unborn Demigods.  What this suggests is that the egg can be used to rebirth Demigods.  This I think is a significant point.   
 

 This rune looks conspicuously similar to Malenia's Great Rune.   
   
 

https://preview.redd.it/twx3va1t1ec91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515c4be9affe71bf8c423e8e8a1303a338e55473

 I would propose a more direct interpretation of Malenia's origin, that she is not the biological daughter of Radagon and Marika, but was reincarnated by Radagon using the amber egg.  The God of Rot's essense was used as a precursor to create Malenia.  This explains why she is described as frail, those produced from the amber egg are also described as frail.   
  

This explains the origin of the children of Rot.  They are always described as unwanted, so where did they come from?  Malenia's offspring, the Scarlet Valkyries are said to rise out of the swamp of Aeonia.  Gowry calls them ""budding flowers.""  In the story trailer put out before the release of Elden Ring, we can see when Malenia blooms in her fight with Radahn, she is giving off seeds or pollen.  I believe it was these seeds or pollen and grew up into Millicent and her sisters.  Malenia's offspring take after their mother, they are all red-haired swordswomen.   


https://preview.redd.it/64kbq3nv1ec91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45ccae14d14420cd0b6bbd66b1a923730f82fa9

  Before it was reincarnated, the God of Rot took the form of a giant ant or scorpion.  If the God of Rot propagates itself through seeds, we can say the children of rot come from seeds deseminated by Malenia's previous form.  That's why they worship Malenia, the rot pests recognize the same essense as that which birthed them.   
 

 Also, why are Malenia and Millicent missing the same limbs?  The immediate assumption is that the scarlet rot makes one's limbs fall off.  Yet we see many humanoid enemies, rot zombies, mushroom people, who are afflicted with rot, yet they have all their arms and legs.  I would submit the reason Malenia and Millicent are missing limbs is not because of the scarlet rot.   


  Remember, there are two weapons we can find in game, the Antspur Rapier and the Scorpion Stinger.  These are described as body parts of the God of Rot that were removed at some point.  So when the God of Rot was reincarnated, Malenia was missing those same limbs.   
 

https://preview.redd.it/rkyzaz942ec91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b6da3890af5f2684e3e52f7d24e2c3d2ac7d05

 So how about Miquella?  He is clearly the reincarnation of St. Trina.  The sword of St. Trina item description states that she just vanished one day.  This was when Radagon captured her and reincarnated her into Miquella.  This is why every Fevor's cookbook includes recipes used by St. Trina clerics until the very last one, where the bewitching branch is attributed to Miquella.      
 

 Miquella somehow has the ability to make cocoons.  This is talked about as if its completely normal, but we see no other demigod doing this.  Making cocoons is probably part of St Trina's lifecycle, similar to blooming with the Crimson Valkyries.   
 

https://preview.redd.it/43s96hnb2ec91.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0d8808f4a0e2acb6cdfb1045edf3d0169c3f8c5

 We are told through many item descriptions that Malenia and Miquella are the children of Marika and Radagon.  However, there are many instances elsewhere where 'child' does not necessarily mean biological relation.  Gideon refers to Nepheli as his daughter.  We also have the situation between Tanith and Zorayas.  These item descriptions don't rule out the possibility of adoption.   


  Also, in the intro movie, when the narrator says, ""Marika's offspring, Demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.""  You see Ranni, Morgott, Mohg(You do see Miquella, but Mohg is also in the image and he is the offspring the narrator is talking about.)  You don't see Malenia until the narrator starts talking about the shattering.  So this could be another clue that Malenia is not the direct offspring of Marika.   


  This narrative of Malenia being the direct offspring of Marika was put forward by the Golden Order to cover up her forbidden origins.  If Malenia and Miquella were found out, they would not be so beloved.  It's probable Malenia and Miquella believed themselves to be children of Marika.  Since the reincarnation process and the unnalloyed gold have mind-altering properties, it probably also messes with memory, so they remember little of their past lives.   
 

 So why would Radagon do this?  The Golden Order wants everything to be incorporated into itself. It wants to control or eliminate anything that doesn't conform to its doctrines.  I believe after Marika's experiences with the giants, she learned that certain Gods simply cannot be killed.   Radagon saw reincarnating these Gods as a way to control them.  And in a certain way, it worked.  Malenia's scarlet Rot was sealed for a time, and she had support from her brother, so the rot was held at bay.   
  

Even knowing all this, the twin prodigies are still Empyreans.  Each of them is the child of a different single God, with Malenia being the child of the God of Rot, and Miquella being the child of St. Trina.

At first I was serving as his bodyguard for invaders. I wanted him to enjoy things. (This turned into him searching them out now when they invade) 

We finally made it to the Fire Giant, I warned him that some the next few bosses will be a lot different. (He didnt enjoy Mohg prior to this) 

He started to notice I wasnt really attacking the fire giant. Just distracting it at moments. 

After a few tries, he got frustrated. I was laughing because know the pain and suffering. He really hadnt experienced that until now. 

We were about to log off, he sat in silence and was like one more try. I felt the air change and I started hyping him up. 

I helped a little more this time, ended up letting myself die. Let him do the second phase alone. He kind of went silent, I knew he was in the zone. Then after a while, I just hear this sigh of relief and quick shout of joy. 

Then he was like I get it now, that rush that hit me was different different 

This ended with him jumping into the forge because he thought thats what he needed to do.

Do they grow or is it like a life juice kind of thing where they end up pouring their innards into a larger pot and add unto themselves to fill it.

"Healing physicks should be considered fair game in duels and I have a couple arguments why","2022-07-18",1658175232,"Healing physicks should be considered fair game in duels and I have a couple arguments why","It's not because ""it's in the game, it's fair game"" nor because it's slower than estus flasks nor because you have to give up the other crystal tear options for it. If you stick double crimson crystal tears in the physick it's a 100% heal. The animation is slower than chugging an estus or two but not by a whole lot. Not every build and playstyle will be able to prevent it and some will even struggle to punish it. Even if you do, the healer probably comes out it with more health than they had. So what you have is a low-risk consumable that can up-to-double your effective health pool in a fight. That's busted enough to be meta: if it's allowed you need to run it, or run a one-shot setup, or be at a huge disadvantage.

And I think that would be a good thing! The number one reason is duels are over way too quickly for my taste. In Dark Souls 3 I felt they hit the sweet spot for being a lot shorter than invasions but still just long enough you spent more time fighting than summoning and going through loading screens. If everyone had access to the same amount of estus heals, then in Elden Ring we could get inflate our effective HP pools to match the dramatically higher damage at meta PVP levels. The problem is hosts will always have more flasks than phantoms and getting the community to decide on a set number of flasks to use would be a fool's errand. The main reason we have community rules for dueling is for fairness, so estus heals are a no go. However if everybody ran double crimson physick we would have a very fair framework for healing on our hands!

I foresee a couple smaller benefits as well. A lot of the community doesn't enjoy using or fighting against one-shot setups. If someone physicks for one-shot setup it will be more obvious since it will be very rare to use physick before the fight if it's not for a big boost. Also, the slower use of the physick should add a more interesting risk and reward dynamic into duels that isn't currently in invasions, since using estus is fast enough to usually not be risky.

Obviously this is very subjective. I know some people prefer duels to be shorter, since for them it's the biggest thing that sets them apart from invasions. My very niche argument about one-shot setups is super subjective as well. Also people will complain that if double crimson physick is meta then it will make all the other crystal tears not worth running. One of the nice things about duels is there's more variety than invasions, and this change in the meta would go against that. My argument against that is the best variety comes from build and playstyle and if people are applying one less buff before fights then that's less downtime between fighting!

Also, if you're here to argue community dueling rules are dumb remember that you don't have to play by them. They're here for people who want to play in a mutually beneficial way.","Eldenring",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w28zoi/healing_physicks_should_be_considered_fair_game/"

There is no interaction or obstacles the entire way (assuming you got rid of the boulder), it's just all several minutes wasted time to get back to the actual fight you're working on. Even when there are enemies to run past, nobody is stopping to pick those off one by one like they do the first time through.

"Unfinished feeling.","2022-07-18",1658171550,"Unfinished feeling.","Hello there.

I've played the game for a little while, not as long as a lot of veterants for sure but still enough to catch on a little sumething. Dont get me wrong the game is amazing for the most part, theres tons to do, tons to explore and the atmosphere is hella good.

However, i believe there is stuff that either feels unfinished or unpolished. Malenia, Blade of miquella, was talked about a ton due to her feeling overpowered, First due to heals when she lands a hit, wich is fine by itself, but then there is also waterfall dance, perhaps the hardest attack to dodge in the game. Both of these moves causes her to regen a lot of health if you were able to even survive it. If that was not enough, she is able to also dodge out of stagger, thus making weapons that does damage out of fast attacks instead one big bonk inneficient.

Enough about her tho, there is also the elden beast. the boss runs away a lot, and by the time you run up to it you are out of stamina to even attack em.

these 2 situations makes me believe the devs had to buff the bosses or remove options from us to makw the bosses not too easy, with malenia its tons of stuff added onto the boss to make her feel like bullshit, for wlden beast its taking away torrent wich would make running after it too easy and trivialise the fight.

Is there anything else that feels unfinished or unpolished about the game, or do you disagree with what i said, im open to discussions.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w27j0k/unfinished_feeling/"

So heres my dilemma: as a paladin, Ive been helping everyone. I dont know if I should help Millicent though, heres what Im thinking as two options:

1) go against Millicent, she will kinda blossom, but shes becoming Melania I would guess -&gt; proceed to Rannis ending

2) get frenzied flame -&gt; assist Millicent -&gt; burn tree -&gt; in my made up lore, character realizes hes not being a good simp to Ranni -&gt; use Miquellas needle to subdue frenzied flame -&gt; proceed to Rannis ending

What is the order of events that she takes place in?

She killed godwyn, or atleast destroyed his soul, in the past. We can find her original body with the black cursemark of death on it on one of the divine towers, right? As such she betrayed the fingers/greater will.

Being the open world element the novelty in the series, I think it's important to give quality feedback about it. At worst I practice my English, so Idgaf anyways.

The thing is, I actually like how the open world in this game is shaped: how everything is connected and makes sense at the same time, in true From Software's spirit; how we've got different areas, each of them with different atmospheres, colors, and histories to tell; how the world feels inmense, or even how there's a lot of different enemy types...

But it has one problem, only one, that started coming to my head as soon as I accessed the first ''legacy dungeon''. They're all so fucking fun. After doing a few ones I was starting to wish they lasted longer and longer.

I like to play looking under every single rock (something that can get old pretty soon on a game of this scale, and that's my fault, I suppose, but that I've done with other open world games without it being exhausting), but after doing that in this open world for hours, I was sooo tired. The open world is cool, yeah, but after Limgrave, you've seen almost everything it has to offer. The zones are different on the outside, but inside, they're all a bunch of different types of churches and caves scattered around. It's all the same with only one exception: those well-fucking-done-and-always-fun legacy dungeons. And I don't want to waste more time, as my opinion is clear and definitive:

If From Software is going to keep doing open world games, they should focus much more on creating damn big legacy dungeons with some open world between them, than on creating a big, beautiful, but pretty boring open world with perfect legacy dungeons here and there. I wouldn't mind a boring open world if it was like Shadow of the Colossus', used mostly to travel between legacy dungeons, but the focus on the world building that made Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro big should be there, always, as a priority.

Anyways, that's my little try on a feedback post on what I think it's one of the few flaws this game as.","Eldenring",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2biyu/after_playing_more_than_300_hours_for_me_the/"

"Save data keeps getting corrupted (PS4)","2022-07-18",1658179359,"Save data keeps getting corrupted (PS4)","TLDR: My save file keeps getting corrupted out of nowhere, have tried a lot of stuff.

Hello. I was having a great time with Elden Ring earlier in the year but got busy with stuff and had to stop playing for a while. My save file was 70 hours in. So 3 days ago i got back into it and had just reached the Volcano Manor. 

There, i died and in the loading screen that followed my PS4 screen went blue and i got a message saying my save file was corrupted. So i tried a lot of stuff like deleting ER and then redownloading it, rebuilding my PS4 databases, and even initializing the console. None of this did anything, but from my googling i discovered that it was relatively common for people's save files to be deleted if they quit the game improperly. I'm pretty sure i never did, and certainly didn't do it in the Volcano Manor, but ok, I'm fine with this save file being gone, whatever i'll just start over.

So i start over yesterday and played for about 6 hours. Today, i went into Caelid (That part with the big dogs and crowdogs) and while still alive, got the same message about my save file being corrupted. At this point i'm kinda losing hope that i'll be able to play the game at all.

Has anyone experienced something similar and have a solution? I'm fine with starting over for a third time, as long as i'm sure that it won't get corrupted again.","Eldenring",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2amzt/save_data_keeps_getting_corrupted_ps4/"

What do you expect, someone to write you down the entire fight for you? When to dodge, when to attack, which way to dodge, what attack to do? If you just want to get better at the fight, either practice and learn its moves by yourself or watch someone on Youtube doing a NO HIT fight against it , and see how they do it. 

Point is, there is way too much too explain, and there is already plenty of information online that will always be more useful than reading some comments on Reddit on it.

That said there are people two or one-shotting 50-60 vigors with plenty of other builds. There's madness craze. There's the lightning that always knows exactly where you are. There's a ton of tactics that allow for low skill to take easy wins when your opponent makes a mistake. RoB is one of the most easily avoided ones. Simple and predictable to parry from a spammer. 

I built my Arcane character to have fun with status effects. Sometimes like to rock RoB because I like the weapon. I vary my attacks and save the ash for opportunities and yet I still get a lot of down points if I get beat, even if it was a great fight. It's a shame.

Personally I think it's fair game , for multiple reasons :    
(1) It's not a flask of crimson tears , you dont have a disproportionate amount of them between host and summon    
(2) just because most people use physicks for buffs at the beginning of the duel , doesn't mean everyone has to , it's a tool that can be employed for different strategies.blow yourself up , get a sudden boost in poise or become temporarily immune to elemental damage, heal , restore fp , raise defences boost your roll distance and high frames .    
(3) it's a strategic tool available to everyone, and limited to a single use , and the animation is long enough that if you are expecting some cheeky strategy (because your opponent didn't drink theirs at the start of the duel) at worst you can still interrupt half of the effect    
(4) incantation and passive regen are also allowed, because they are also fair in principle","Eldenring",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2fyoc/what_are_your_thoughts_on_healing_physicks_in/"

Feel free to keep it simple. I can Google any items/gear you suggest. I say katana because they are fast and often have bleed build up but I suppose I'm open to anything as well if there's something out there worth mentioning in the same style.

An example is just using the uchigatana from start to finish. But I'm looking for something more interesting and I did hear/read about an uchi in the off hand with frost and something else bleed in the main hand? But then I realised that was with the moonveil an I used that my first run (got past fire giant an randomly decided I wanted to restart). I only used magic outside of boss fights so essentially I was just using a katana and shield in boss fights so I thought let's do it properly. I've never dual wielded in any dark souls game before so it's time to try it an not have a shield to fall back on. 

Also is it worth putting anything into faith, just for self buffing spells? I want to stay away from intelligence because I've not touched faith in this game yet. Or is that not worth it. I'm assuming outside of that I will be just raising my arcane an my qol stats.

I tried colossal greatswords and the speed just annoyed me and I'm not into spamming jump attacks. I tried a great shield and spear but the shield did not do what I thought it would. Different conversation I don't want to have here.

I'm looking for build advice because everything I find online is either river of blood spamming the ash or spamming dual wielding jump attacks and I'm not interested either of them. I want to actually play the game.

Also, and I know this sounds a bit weird, but what is your backup plan for things that are bleed resistant.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2f39i/dual_katana_bleed_build_that_doesnt_use_river_of/"

"Melina's possible father and Gloam eyed queen theory","2022-07-19",1658189356,"Melina's possible father and Gloam eyed queen theory","So recently I started playing the souls series and thankfully at the best time with Elden rings release. I love lore and story telling so I had an idea in the works today and wanted to share on the off chance I'm on to something. 

Spoilers of course if you don't want to be spoiled!!


So going over the frenzy ending, you don't sacrifice Melina to burn the tree. At the end you see her walk onto screen, she has the same clothes, the same hand burns or scars, but what differs greatly are two main points. 

1. Her hair changes to a darker color losing the faded red in it
2. Her before yellow eye is now devoid of color and is white, while the crow foot has faded revealing the purple eye. 

The first theory of her lineage is I think she's potentially Maliketh's daughter, I know it probably sounds crazy but hold on. Her hair change really was bugging me, because if we try to draw a parallel to Hyetta, her body remains where she died and her new body is the exact same as before. 

Let's put a pin in that for a second so I can discuss the etymology of ""gloam"". I swear it's getting good now. 


Looking into gloam leads you to the anagram ""Lagom"" which in a few different languages it can mean Maroon and to turn Blue from lack of oxygen. It also can mean ""just right"". 


I think Melina inherited destined death from Maliketh and when the tree burned the yellow holy side of Melina died, and the destined death side was freed. Like Marika's hair changed from blonde to red to symbolize being taken over, so did Melina's. 


The rest of the theory I'm unsure of at this point. Is it destined death itself that's unlocked or was Melina a Vessel created by The Gloam eyed queen and maliketh so that her soul may inhabit another body like some of the other stories involve. Or maybe I'm completely wrong and Melina is literally the elden ring and when the tree is burned all that's left is Destined Death. 



I didn't get to touch upon it much but I think the whole ""blue from lack of oxygen"" definitely ties in with the gloam eyed queen and Ronnies doll being blue.

Bleed scales from Arcane, and so does something called Occult. I have no idea how to put occult on a weapon at this point in the game but regardless.

Essentially, I'm wondering how viable of a build it would be, to dump everything into STAMINA, HEALTH, ENDURANCE - EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER WANT... and also Arcane (as well as hitting minimal skill requirements for dex/faith/whatever other random things).

This will probably be a little long, but I've gotta get my thoughts out. I just beat Elden Ring, slayed the Elden Beast, and did Ranni's ending, and I can't express how absolutely happy I feel right now!

This was the first FromSoft game I've ever gotten into. DS2 was the first I ever tried back in 2014-15, but I just couldn't get into it. I tried DS1 two years ago, but I didn't get far. I've wanted to get into these games for years, and ER did just that in spades. It exceeded any expectations I ever had. The world was an incredible place to explore. The best open world I've ever explored compared to anything else I've played. The bosses were a spectacle, absolutely gruelling and rage-inducing monsters, Demigods, and everything in between! The incredible variety in builds and play styles, the many ways to help struggling players like Spirit Ashes, Ashes of Wars, etc. The absolutely incredible music with each boss fight; from heart pounding excitement to regal beauty to unimaginable terror. The intriguing and fascinating lore, the heartbreaking stories, memorable characters you meet along the way. I'll never forget the jolly Iron Fist Alexander, Blaidd, Ranni, sniveling little Seluvis, Sir Gideon Ofnir the ALL KNOWING, Roderika, Hewg, and so many others. 

I don't think I could ever forget that first moment you step out into Limgrave, seeing the beautiful Erdtree in the distance. Battling Godrick and seeing him graft a dragon's head to his arm! Descending into Siofra River as you see the underground stars. Getting terrified by the walking hands at Caria Manor! The build up and battle against Radahn; probably my favorite moment in the entire game! Arriving on the Altus Plateau and my jaw just dropped when I saw the Capital, and I stood there for at least a minute. Getting transported to Volcano Manor because of Rya, and the music just gave me such ominous chills. Struggling so hard on Rykard, for some reason! Entering Leyndell and seeing the massive dragon body! Discovering the Deeproot Depths and fighting Fortissax; absolutely blown away by the spectacle of the fight and arena! Ascending the Mountaintops of the Giants, and battling the Fire Giant! Setting the Erdtree aflame. The battle against Maliketh as he jumped all over the arena, blasting me with Destined Death! Fucking Placidusax, need I say more for him!? Exploring the Consecrated Snowfield and stumbling upon Mohgwyn's Palace and the path to the Haligtree. The fucking heart pounding battle with Malenia; having heard so much about her! Finally heading back to the burning Erdtree and battle Godfrey, and finally Radagon and Elden Beast. Half an hour of attempts on the final bosses, and I couldn't help but yell out and cry when I saw the Elden Beast's health reach zero! 

I could just keep going and going. This game was absolutely incredible! I know it has a lot of issues people have with it. PvP is terribly unbalanced, a lot of the bosses have bullshit attacks, fucking Malenia, lots of reused bosses, repetitive catacombs and dungeon designs, Mountaintops of the Giants is not a fun place to explore, lots of late game enemies hit really freaking hard, even for a Vigor 60 player that I was with buffs and such, and tons of other things other people have expressed at nauseam. But, at least to me personally, none of that really detracted from my experience. This game was a masterpiece, one of the greatest games I have ever played, probably will ever play it feels like. This was one of the greatest experiences a game has ever given me. I genuinely haven't felt this way about a game in over a decade. I am so glad that I gave Elden Ring a chance, a FromSoft game another chance. I want to give the other games a chance too now, and I know they're very different from ER, but that feeling of pushing through and overcoming adversity is one of the greatest feelings I've ever had in a video game. If the bosses in DS3 or Sekiro are just as good as in ER, or better as I've heard from a lot of people, I want to challenge them like I did here.

It's so dumb, but I'm still shaking from it all. This game... How do you top an experience like that? I am so happy right now. I actually beat my first FromSoft game.

I killed Varre after a while because I didnt like his attitude.

I went through three to four characters, before I finally stuck with one. The first one was an Astrologer that I stopped using because I didnt realize there was a lock on, so I thought magic sucked.

Ive now beat the game three times with that character, and the first ending I got was the Age of Stars. I didnt even realize that we were married, and I completely forgot a wedding gift.

I went in front of Raya Lucaria in my very first duel, and I didnt even realize that healing was a no-no.

I think that the Age of Stars is the best ending canonically, but gameplay-wise Lord of Frenzied Flame is easily the best.

I think anyone who complains about weapons or builds in pvp in the game is stoopid and lazy. The game was made that way, and there is a way to counter everything, you just havent found it. And complaining about seeing the same thing over and over is also dumb, its just means you get more practice against the hard playstyles to fight.","Eldenring",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2k47x/confession_time_heres_why_i_got/"

This is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, ""newbie"" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.

Well written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just dont like. This includes so and so boss is stupid and too difficult.

If you are interested in the game but dont own it yet, please dont post should I buy this game? or Is this game worth it?. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you havent, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And thats okay!

For the week I played this game, I initially did not have the best time because of the poor optimization of the PC version. I would die many times due to frame drops, in a game where pin point dodging is crucial. My deaths were out of my control. I ended up beating the game with an Azur Comet build and the pre-nerfed mimic tear. I still enjoyed my time with the game though.

My question is: Is Elden Ring performing well on the PC right now? I am considering a replay. It's a shame I could only experience this game for the first time only once (obviously lol) but that won't stop me from experiencing it again. My specs are slightly above the recommended requirements listed for Elden Ring (which is why I was a little angry at FromSoft when it came to my game's unacceptable performance.)

I sometimes look up the quest beats because I know that in From games of old you can easily break questlines by not doing things in the perfect order, so I'm paranoid. 

I didn't think to do this for Boc. His progression seemed to closely follow mine. When I saw him in the Royal Capital I went autopilot clearing the dialogue options because there is usually only one path. Clear all dialogue. 

I wouldn't have in a million years thought of using ""You're Beautiful"" instead of giving him the item the game prompted me to give him. I even have that exact Prattling Pate in a quickslot.

Im walking towards this burning church, when lo and behold I am invaded by ANASTASIA, TARNISHED-EATER. Spooky name. I had on a heavy load out and didnt have time to change up before this mad woman with a butcher knife is raining blows on me. Somehow we both managed to reach the absolute end of our health. One hit will end this one way or another. She starts a multi hit combo, I block, her first strike bounces, I hit counter, but her next attack is already coming. Our attacks pass within an inch of each other. And somehow her attack misses my throat by a hairs breadth. My flail clips her stomach. She drops to one knee, and as she fades away my tarnished stares into the distance without emoting (mostly because I dropped my controller lol).

"602","2022-07-19",1658199226,"Which ending is the most positive, and why is the Age of Order","A lot of people oversight this ending, but in my opinion is the best one, because it's the one that solidifies the Order as it should've been from the start, no longer Gods can interfere with it or alter it, like Marika did. Death was part of the Order, but she removed it, making her new Order seem better at first, but eventually colapsting for its imperfection. The Perfect Order prevents the intereference of even the Greater Will, after all it is an Outer God too. This ending is about knowledge and ascension, learning what the Greater Will had to teach, its virtues and mistakes, then creating a self-sustaining Order without the meddling of any outer forces. 

I like Ranni's ending too, she wants the Order to be far away from humanity, basically leaving the world to govern itself, flaws and all. My only problem is that it leaves humanity vulnerable to the influence of other Outer Gods, and that can backfire a lot, the Perfect Order rejects every and all godly interventions, instead it only follows its own principles.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2htf2/which_ending_is_the_most_positive_and_why_is_the/"

What's the point? PvP used to be extremely enjoyable, I spent hundreds of hours in DS3 and DS2 just invading. Now I barely want to touch it. Invaders have always had a disadvantage, and rightly so, but no it's no longer just a disadvantage, it's straight crippling. Been invading in Elden Ring for maybe 25 hours now, most common scenario is a 1v3 with overleveled phantoms. The gameplay loop is consistently *invade-&gt;die instantaneously* 

No meaningful rewards, fun pvp is rare. The odd taunter's tongue host is nice, though the playing field seems to only consist of 1-2 hits builds.

It's not fun anymore, why even add it to the game? 

And before you downvote, remember that invasions aren't ""a horrible no good downright awful thing to do"", they're an integral part of Soulsborne. Elden Ring is just easy mode for hosts now. The game is fairly challenging if you just use ashes and npc summons, phantoms just make it a cakewalk.","Eldenring",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2hst5/whats_the_point_of_invasions/"

The ""two fingers"" underneath the Cathedral of Manus Celes that Ranni kills seem to actually be the same as the three fingers underneath Leyndell. The forefinger and middle finger are the most prominent, but a thumb appears to be jutting out and into the ground. All sets of fingers appear to belong to a left hand, as indicated by the thumb webbing and the cut side. Does this make any sense lore wise? Also considering that the other demigods' two fingers are on top of the divine towers, why would Ranni's be under the cathedral?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: after some discussion, it seems the best answer is that the fingers are the standard Greater will fingers, as the game outright states so, and all lore seems to point that way.

"942","2022-07-19",1658195662,"I think I have a decent theory as to why Godwyns corpse looks the way it does.","The Twinbird Kite Shield implies that theres an outer god of death. 

Heres a section of the Item Description: Shield featuring a vividly painted twinbird.
The twinbird is said to be the envoy of an outer god, and mother of the Deathbirds

The implication being an outer god of death, which would make sense. After all, if there can be an outer god of Blood (formless mother) and an outer god of rot (The scorpion) there could absolutely be an outer god of death. 

Given that Godwyn was the first Demigod to die, its possible that the outer god of death marked him as his terrestrial link to the world, as the Formless Mother did to Mohg, and the Scorpion did to Melania. 

Given that Godwyn was essentially grafted to the Erdtrees base, I think its possible that the outer god of death planted Deathblight into Godwyns corpse with the intent of corrupting the Erdtree in an attempt to bring about its own age (much as Formless Mother wants to do via Mohg) 

This link allows the god to corrupt beings like the Ulcerated Tree Spirits, and create new beings such as the Basilisks. The eyes of Godwyn become the eyes of the outer god of death, which of course pop up all over the place, even in Farum Azula. 

So this is an outer god that created the Basilisks and Wormfaces, that corrupted the Tree Spirits, and created the Deathblight. And Through Godwyns corpse it stealthily corrupting the Erdtree, giving rise to the Deathroot, the eyes that appear everywhere, and the Deathblight itself. Its even corrupting the water source around Leyndell, evidenced by the crabs that have Godwyns face on their backs (and could potentially be how the Wormfaces are created, by people drinking the Death-infected, leech-ridden waters) 

So with all of that in mind, I think that Godwyns form has become that of the outer god of death, with aspects of everything it creates/corrupts. The Corpse has the eyes surrounding it, Deathblight within it, a tail for treading through bodies of water, the webbed body of a basilisk, and the face of the outer god of death itself, with the only items of Godwyn remaining being his golden hair, bracelets, and blue burial shroud. A prince of death indeed.

Thats my theory, anyway.","Eldenring",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2gks1/i_think_i_have_a_decent_theory_as_to_why_godwyns/"
