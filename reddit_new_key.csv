"I just played Malenia for the first time..what the hell is this??","2022-07-16",1657990946,"I just played Malenia for the first time..what the hell is this??","This whole game so far was pretty easy to me, almost disappointing to be honest. The only boss I had problems with was Mohg because I didn't know about the flask thing and just quickly healed few times during ""Nihil"" phase. But still it only took an hour or so. I haven't really struggled with anything in this game so far..but this Malenia thing is crazy.

I don't know if it's my build or what but this feels impossible. I spent few hours playing and now I can get to the second phase here and there (mainly by spamming hoarfrost stomp in phase 1 so it's kind of a cheese ngl) but phase 2 is just fucking impossible, there's no openings to attack at all and what's the most frustrating part is that she is always in your face so there's no way to keep distance and prepare for that sword dance like you would do in phase 1. Like as soon as I see she is doing that shit I know it's over..Not to mention that you can't get hit at all because if you do she heals and it's already impossible to find openings to attack..how is everything so easy in this game and they give you the hardest boss ever created just like that??","Eldenring",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w0l7dx/i_just_played_malenia_for_the_first_timewhat_the/"

I started a new game. No new game+ cuz i like self harm lol.

I choose Samurai and stayed with the default weapon.

Now i foundba Claymore with Lion's Claw.

"Bow tips","2022-07-16",1657989087,"Bow tips","Hello all,

I recently completed a bow main run; and just wanted to share some stuff I found useful.


Stats: lvl150 

(Vig 50)(End 42)(Mind 12)(STR 37)(Dex 60)(INT 14)(FTH 8)(ARC 8)

Bows: 


Horn bow +24 (rain/enchanted)


Black bow +10 (barrage) *main bow


Pulley bow +9 (mighty shot) *sniper bow


Lions Greatbow +9 (Radhans rain) *large boss killer


Main armor and talismans:


Vulgar militia set with aristocrats hat, Green turtle, Arrow sting, Erdtree favor +2, flex (spear, kindred of rot or Dragoncrest shield) *this is what I wear 90% of the time.


Spellblade set, arrow sting, magic scorpion charm, Dragon crest greatshield, Alexander jar *this with the horn bow and rain of arrows/mighty shot/Enchanted shot really chunks and is great against enemies weak to magic damage or strong to physical damage. (Use your flask to make damage even higher)


My only incants/spells were beastial vitality and flame, cleanse me; I have to put the two finger heirloom on to use it, and then remove the heirloom after for other stuff.


Side arms:


Misery (lightning/Golden vow)


Misery (lightning/ parry)


Broadsword (cold/storm stomp)


The arrows are all over the place, depending on what I was doing. All of them have their benefits. Pvp
Is lightning/storm wing arrows and serpent. Most bosses are bloodbone/cold bone or bloodbone/serpent.


Note: lightning arrows scale with dex, fire and holy scale with faith on a faith scaling bow, magic scale with intellect on an intellect scaling bow. Bleed and poison scale with arcane on an arcane scaling bow (serpent bow was great at low levels)


Due to split damage storm wing and Base arrows will do the most damage on most things.


Golden arrows will stop undead from rising and they do more damage to undead but really fall off late game.

"Hot take: Malenia isn't actually THAT difficult","2022-07-16",1657983065,"Hot take: Malenia isn't actually THAT difficult","She's just the result of lazy boss development.

So, fighting Malenia last night and I got to thinking.
Most of her attacks are telegraphed and dodged with relative ease.
She staggers fairly easily.
Her health isn't overly stuffed.

I can't help but feel that someone created a really really cool boss. But some higher up said nah, she's too easy for this late in the game. So, they went back, added waterfowl; ( or maybe just added the second stage to it) and added her life leech ability. 
And now, she's unfairly difficult. Take away her life leech and give her some extra health and she's easily one of the best designed and most difficult bosses. 

Anyways, these are my thoughts fighting her as a strength build.
Any thoughts?","Eldenring",47,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w0ie52/hot_take_malenia_isnt_actually_that_difficult/"
"When does this game get really good?","2022-07-16",1657981213,"When does this game get really good?","I'm currently deep into Ray Lucaria. I'm focused mainly on sorceries right now.

I feel like I've been playing the same way for most of the game. I have like 15 sorceries or something, but only the large glintstone shard is actually worth using. All those little crystal barrages and ambush shards etc, are just garbage.

I've also tried every weapon I can, but at the end of the day I've only really played with uchigatana and the sword that spawns some blades that shoot out.

So IDK man...I feel like I'm about to be done with the first 2 major zones, and my playstyle all game has been the exact same. Go to a boss and doge dodge dodge glintstone glintstone glintstone doge doge doge.....it's super repetitive and boring.

The game's open world isn't really interesting. It's Dark Souls without loading screens. No stories or like ""ooo I wonder what's the story with this little town??"". It's more of the same pretty stuff to look at but really it's a game of kill stuff on your way to boss die to boss a few times run back from waypoint to boss several times kill boss repeat.

So is there a point where this game gets significantly better? Does the next stone start to give the really awesome spells and weapons that'll actually progress my character?

1) They spoil the boss locations. I liked to be surprised by hidden bosses the first time I encounter them but seeing a stake or even the icon when I open the hud ruins it too often.
2) They make the first attempt at a boss much harder than subsequent attempts because they don't allow you to heal at them yet they heal you when you revive. I usually like to try my best on a first attempt but when you reach the boss and you're low on hp it's easier to just die and respawn than try your best. I'd prefer either a run to the boss or a grace before the boss.

TLDR: I like the ""Oh no, a big monster jumped on me and I'm low on health, better do my best to survive"" feeling more than the ""oh there's a boss coming, I should just die and respawn so I get my health back"".","Eldenring",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w0fk5m/i_dont_like_the_stakes_of_marika/"
"Opinion on when to do some optional bosses","2022-07-16",1657973386,"Opinion on when to do some optional bosses","Note: Please no spoilers

Greetings fellow gamers, I am an Elden Ring gamer. Before this game I beat Sekiro, DS3,DSR,BB.

I beat DS3's Dlc's  bosses at Ng+3. I beat DS r's dlc bosses in Ng+.

I beat BB dlc bosses at NG+(first time was brutal the first boss ate my character alive had to go to Ng, then come back to Ng+)

Currently I am doing NG. I am in mount gelmir.

I want Elden Ring's endgame optional bosses to be insane. I was thinking whether or not should i face Malenia and the infamous duo boss in Ng, or Ng+ or Ng+2? Because I want them to be super hard insane. Please don't spoil me though.

How much scaling(harder) do the endgame optional bosses get in these Ng cycles

and second lord of blood was the same with my mimic and uchingana lvl 23 now and was just behind him spamming attacks and dodging i died once at lord of blood but that's was all
is using the mimic bad cause i think that's the case also why i'm overleveled cause i finished callied map entirely and limegrave and the underground all and half of lunaria

Ive complained a few times that most bosses seem to be a game of waiting for them to finish several unpunishable combos for soooo looong before getting a hit in. 
Oddly, however, it seems like bosses that people complain about actually seem to have a a lot of rhythm and back-and-forth, and while hard, always give you a way in. Hell, unlike Artorias from DS1, Malenia actually gives you breathing room between exchanges, and isolating the Godskin Duo is surprisingly manageable.

Renala is a boss fight that when you defeat is still there and is no longer interested in fighting you. Rykard wants you to join the family and devour the gods together, and after doing Varres quest and being invited to Mohgs Palace,  Mohg invites you to the birthplace of his dynasty then proceeds to beat the fuck out of you. 

I just dont understand how even after completing some of the very specific questlines you still get the same outcome, you have to fight these guys.

I never really speak my mind though since that is their way of playing, not everyone can be like me fighting a boss until 1am. Its just a annoyance that they cant git good fast enough.

"22","2022-07-17",1658079498,"My thoughts on Elden Rings lackluster OST","I have been thoroughly enjoying the game, but after 200 hours I have found the music to be rather lacking. The soundtracks are roughly divided into BOSS music, COMBAT music and EXPLORATION music. The Boss music is good overall, the Combat music mediocre, and the Exploration music almost entirely absent.

I fully enjoyed the Ancestral Spirit the Godskin Duo, the epic Radagon music, and the stunning transition to Elden Beast. However, the rest of the boss music feel too similar. They all employ big orchestral sounds and choruses, making it hard to distinguish one another. Sure the Lichdragon fight uses organ because of the association with death, the Godrick one is more dissonant, and they use singers with different registers to better suit the fight, but at the end of the day they all give the epic, mere tarnished challenging mighty demigod vibe. The worst offender are Morgott and Mogh fights. Despite being twin Omens, one is defending the Erdtree with honor, while the other is consorting with an outer god and infatuated with a child Empyrean. The music does not give depth to the characters.

Whats worse is that almost all Exploration music are just white noise or a couple notes on repeat. For me the game time is split between 20% Bosses(remembrance) and 80% exploration and dungeons. And for the 80% I got stunning visuals but nothing for my ears. The only worthwhile music is the Altus Plateau, which reminds me of autumn, and the subconscious horror music in Caelid. I get not putting music in dungeons, since it is a tense area and music could serve as a distraction. But it is a huge waste when you hear all but ambience noises on Torrent. Compare that to Witcher 3, where you have the stunning songs in Skellige, sunny tunes in Toussaints, and Eastern European folk music. The Elden ring, despite offering the most gorgeous and diverse terrains, have no matching melodies.

This is especially a shame because the game has such deep lores connecting enemies and locations. All the minor Erdtrees could have a variation of a main Erdtree theme, with the putrid ones having motifs from Caelid. Or create a theme for the outer god Twinbird, with Deathbirds, Godwyn, Black Knives sharing elements of that theme. For players who do not read item descriptions, music can provide an instinctual link between element of the lore.

"28","2022-07-17",1658069272,"Which Boss has the best second phase and why? (Including transitions).","My personal favourites are:

Godrick - Goes from average boss fight to ""Holy cow he just cut his arm off!"" to ""WHAT IS HE DOING TO THAT DRAGON?!?!"". Made it very memorable for me. ""FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL, BEAR WITNESS!""

Rennala - Similar to Ludwig in Bloodborne, she starts off as just a shadow of her former self, albeit less horrifically than the demon-horse-man. The second phase restores her to full power. A sorceress so adept she would make Gideon wet his pants.

Rykard - For those who suffer from ophidiophobia, the first phase was bad enough. Cut to the serpent turning around to reveal the giant, rocky face of who was once Praetor Rykard. The entire fight was a true spectacle, especially when he draws his sword from the serpent's maw. ""TOGETHAA""

Godfrey/Hoarah Loux - Whilst Rennala follows the theme of redemption (like the aforementioned Ludwig), and Rykard's shows a further descent into madness and debauchery (similarly to Laurence), it can be argued that Godfrey simply turns from one legend, to another. It is also the most honourable fight in the game (both phases) in my opinion. Radahn is a close second, Redmanes please don't kill me.

"44","2022-07-17",1658043739,"Game is balanced towards dual wielding and bleed!","My first playthrough was with one big bonk, coming from the Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I thought that was the shit, until , my next playthrough, I equipped another big bonk in the other hand and my DPS basically doubled. 

Bosses that I thought were fairly healthy just melted and their stance was broken every 3rd jumping L1. 

Just as an example, the final boss (Radagon + Elden Beast) has over 35k health combined , in two different health bars, whilst in 

*  **Ds3** Soul of Cinder had just a bit over 10k (both phases combined)
* **Bloodborne** Gherman had 14k whilst Moon Presence didn't even have 9k health. 
* **Ds2** Throne Watcher and Defender had 8k combined and Nashandra didn't even had 9k health (And you could still powerstance).
* **Ds1** Gwyn has 4k health.

The average big strength weapon doesn't do that much more damage to justify enemies having 3 times the health, people thought Yhorm was tanky at 27k hp, well Fire Giant has 43k hp AND rolls around like a madman.

So considering bosses have way more health, Bleed being % damage is much more useful, and the fact that there are no extra requirement for dual wielding (beside having enough equip load , I guess), make it almost necessary if you wanna keep up with the huge health bar that bosses have.

Also FYI , Malenia has 33k health in NG , both phases combined, that's more than ANY Dark Souls boss ever, AND she heals if she hits you.","Eldenring",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w11yxj/game_is_balanced_towards_dual_wielding_and_bleed/"

This is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, ""newbie"" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.

Well written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just dont like. This includes so and so boss is stupid and too difficult.

If you are interested in the game but dont own it yet, please dont post should I buy this game? or Is this game worth it?. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you havent, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And thats okay!

Lastly, be friendly! We are all here because we are interested in the same game! Please treat your fellow players with respect.

"59","2022-07-17",1658027412,"Can't dodge Malenias water dance thing. And can't roll past her. NG+","Can anyone give me some tips. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I watched a tutorial that showed and said which direction to dodge and so on. But I just cant execute the moves. My camera keeps flipping around and I don't know which direction to press. Nomatter what, I always move into her like she was magnetic. Even if I'm not pressing forward. This also happens with an other attack of hers. The tutorial said to roll past her. But I keep getting stuck on her. So I roll away instead and try to take minimal damage.

My guess is that I get hit a little bit and that traps me. I don't get full on stunned but I become super slow. Trying to get the beginning right even is super hard. If I try rolling past her, I get hit by the lingering hitbox. If I run past her beforehand, she just turns around and now i'm in front of her. So she moves the hitbox that way and catches me also. The tutorial showed always locked on. but maybe I should try without target lock. Even though that makes following her location harder. I'm even thinking, my camera settings are wrong or something. You can see it in this video (27 seconds in) how the camera is going crazy. And this is one of the times I did the best against it. Usually I just get stuck on her like a magnet and take every hit. I don't have trouble rolling past other enemies and bosses.

"66","2022-07-17",1658022732,"theory about the meaning of the name ""The Lands Between""","its not a very long or complicated theory, but it goes like this  
ive noticed many similarities in elden ring and dark souls,  
so many in fact that it was hard for me to say they are 100% unrelated..  
think about it: both worlds are based around great trees, dragons and fire  
especially with the ""Frenzied Flame"" which seems like a stand-in for the Profand Flame from ds3  
along with bosses and enemies that act the same (erdtree avatars being stray demons, omenkillers as capra demons, etc)  
with actual enemies appearing in both(!!) games like the basilisk and skeletons..  
so my theory would be: ""The Lands Between"" are literally what the name means:  
they are the lands between FromSoft games  
like, dark souls taking place in one part of the world, demon souls in another, elden ring takes place in the lands between those  
it explains the relations as these are different biomes and species of the same world  
and might be elden ring is taking place after the ""age of darkness"" ending of ds3  
as the firekeeper says  ""**But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness. Like embers, linked by lords past.""**   
meaning you are stopping the first cycle (which contained multiple mini-cycles in which the dark souls game are taking place) of light and dark, but one day something else will come and cycles will continue.","Eldenring",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w0w48b/theory_about_the_meaning_of_the_name_the_lands/"

I have recently made a new character designed for being summoned to help defeat bosses I enjoyed in my last playthroughs and since I am relatively new to souls pvp (I'm experienced in pve) I had some questions.

Which bosses are the most summoned for? 
I really want to do bosses like Rykard, Fire Giant and Mohgwyn and was wondering if they're frequent summon spots. I'm also down to help people stuck on bosses like Godskin Duo and Commander Niall.

Can you be summoned for bosses you have already defeated?
I'm currently helping people with Godrick and wanted to know if I could still help if I was to beat him in my world.

What are the reccommended rune and weapon levels (preferably somber weapons) for popular bosses?
I don't want to accidentally overlevel myself.

Which areas get most traffic?
Would I be more likely to find people at the nearest grace, at the beginning of the area, or by the fog?

Hey guys so Im a little bit curious as to what just happened, so I started playing the game just yesterday and kept resting on light of grace every chance I got to level up. 

I was at level 8 and everytime I rested at the grace of light it would respawn the groups of soldiers and I would just sneak kill them all again to gain runes to increase my health. I got the most recent grace of light before the boss fight with Margit and Melina came before me talking none sense, like she isnt my maiden and that she has no guidance for me, I just ignored it and level up myself from lvl 8 -&gt; lvl 12 from health. 

I summoned help prior to fighting margit and I was utterly defeated. It was not one shot defeat so it gave me hope that if I strategize I can beat him. I went and rested on the grace of light once more before heading back to margit and the option to talk with melinda showed up again. I pressed it and melinda says I was wrong about you, I merely tested you, I also lied about having no guidance, rest your hand upon me and I will take you to the roundtable hold 

Im shocked, Im not worthy yet, I mean I still have all my starting weapons and gear yet Im in the roundtable hold? Am I missing something? Is this an achievement ? What do you think ?

This is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, ""newbie"" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.

Well written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just dont like. This includes so and so boss is stupid and too difficult.

If you are interested in the game but dont own it yet, please dont post should I buy this game? or Is this game worth it?. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you havent, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And thats okay!

Lastly, be friendly! We are all here because we are interested in the same game! Please treat your fellow players with respect.

I had on a heavy load out and didnt have time to change up before this mad woman with a butcher knife is raining blows on me. Somehow we both managed to reach the absolute end of our health. One hit will end this one way or another. She starts a multi hit combo, I block, her first strike bounces, I hit counter, but her next attack is already coming. Our attacks pass within an inch of each other. And somehow her attack misses my throat by a hairs breadth. My flail clips her stomach. She drops to one knee, and as she fades away my tarnished stares into the distance without emoting (mostly because I dropped my controller lol).

Feel free to keep it simple. I can Google any items/gear you suggest. I say katana because they are fast and often have bleed build up but I suppose I'm open to anything as well if there's something out there worth mentioning in the same style.

An example is just using the uchigatana from start to finish. But I'm looking for something more interesting and I did hear/read about an uchi in the off hand with frost and something else bleed in the main hand? But then I realised that was with the moonveil an I used that my first run (got past fire giant an randomly decided I wanted to restart). I only used magic outside of boss fights so essentially I was just using a katana and shield in boss fights so I thought let's do it properly. I've never dual wielded in any dark souls game before so it's time to try it an not have a shield to fall back on. 

Also is it worth putting anything into faith, just for self buffing spells? I want to stay away from intelligence because I've not touched faith in this game yet. Or is that not worth it. I'm assuming outside of that I will be just raising my arcane an my qol stats.

I tried colossal greatswords and the speed just annoyed me and I'm not into spamming jump attacks. I tried a great shield and spear but the shield did not do what I thought it would. Different conversation I don't want to have here.

I'm looking for build advice because everything I find online is either river of blood spamming the ash or spamming dual wielding jump attacks and I'm not interested either of them. I want to actually play the game.

Also, and I know this sounds a bit weird, but what is your backup plan for things that are bleed resistant.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w2f39i/dual_katana_bleed_build_that_doesnt_use_river_of/"

After a few tries, he got frustrated. I was laughing because know the pain and suffering. He really hadnt experienced that until now.

I.e., making a tedious long run back to the boss fight you just got your ass kicked at. 

However, it's by no means perfect in Elden ring. Take the Rennala fight, for example: you must run all the way from the Debate Parlor Grace, on to the ramp on the right, along to the back, pull the leaver to reset the lift, go up the lift, then re-enter the boss room. There is no interaction or obstacles the entire way (assuming you got rid of the boulder), it's just all several minutes wasted time to get back to the actual fight you're working on. Even when there are enemies to run past, nobody is stopping to pick those off one by one like they do the first time through.

Malenia, Blade of miquella, was talked about a ton due to her feeling overpowered, First due to heals when she lands a hit, wich is fine by itself, but then there is also waterfall dance, perhaps the hardest attack to dodge in the game. Both of these moves causes her to regen a lot of health if you were able to even survive it. If that was not enough, she is able to also dodge out of stagger, thus making weapons that does damage out of fast attacks instead one big bonk inneficient.

Enough about her tho, there is also the elden beast. the boss runs away a lot, and by the time you run up to it you are out of stamina to even attack em.

these 2 situations makes me believe the devs had to buff the bosses or remove options from us to makw the bosses not too easy, with malenia its tons of stuff added onto the boss to make her feel like bullshit, for wlden beast its taking away torrent wich would make running after it too easy and trivialise the fight.

Is there anything else that feels unfinished or unpolished about the game, or do you disagree with what i said, im open to discussions.","Eldenring",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w27j0k/unfinished_feeling/"

I personally dont think Spirit Summons trivialize certain bosses or at least not to the extent players make it out to be(unless its mimic tear, but even then you need a very strong build). Do they make it easier? Most definitely I 100% agree. Do they make a large majority of the main bosses a walk in the park? Honestly not at all, in my experience I was still getting destroyed by guys like Maliketh and Melania even with having a pretty strong build. I definitely do agree that there are a bunch of bosses that definitely have unfair moves/combos, timing, etc that make it very hard to beat them 1-on-1.

But even then there was still that great feeling of euphoria from beating them and not a sense of yeah not playing this again.

Second thought would be the dlc area, with the cut memory invasion content, fromsoft's infatuation with time travel in their dlcs, and how Sekiro's bell charms allow you to go into a characters memories, you could use an item with a signifant connection to a character to go into their memories, and one of the items you get is Miquelas Needle, in short the dlc area is Miquela's or Malenia's memories where you could fight Malenia and Radahn in their primes.

So after finishing the game, i can say that this one wasn't FromSoft's best try. I will try my best to explain why i personally don't think that Elden Ring was that good FS game compared to their other games

1. The open world. I was totally impressed by the open world in the beginning of the game. When i set my foot at Limgrave i was like ""my god this looks amazing, time to have some fun"". But as soon as i left Limgrave (including stormvile) i lost my interest in open world. The thing is that the other areas weren't as good. The problem was simple : many wide open areas with a lot of reused stuff. I arrived at Liurnia of the Lakes and all i saw was a big lake (what a surprise) but it was really dull. I mean, i was running around to explore and i found some interesting caves and ruins but it wasn't something impressive. I mostly got lost because everything started looking the same so i just used the map to arrive at the Academy which was a really well designed place. After finishing there i reached Caelid which was really well designed (vision wise) to show us how Malenia destroyed everything, MtotG was actually meh and let down, Farum Azula was amazing, Miquellas haligtree was good and pretty much every area was good looking. What really killed me in the open world was the copy pasted assets. The catacombs are exactly the same, the ruins are the same, the caves are the same, same rock design everywhere, it made me get bored pretty quickly. I was looking here and there just to see the same architect everywhere which made me getting bored pretty easily. The art direction was the best i've seen in video games but after sometime it started feeling the same thing over and over. I could excuse it in games that were supposed to simulate real world (gta, rdr2) but in a fantasy game it ruined the immersion in my perspective.
2. Exploration and mobs: These 2 are combined, and i ll be honest, when it comes to normal enemies, this game is the worst in the series. They are literally copy pasted (Godrick's soldiers are in late game too with different colour, commoners, most knights are the same everywhere with the same attack pattern, dogs and rats infesting the place, uninteresting enemies like the big blobs that can poison you, these fat dudes with the swords you find at Atlus and later at catacombs etc.). This  game reuses so many mobs later that i got to the point of thinking ""they just took the map and placed enemies randomly by just buffing their hp"". It reminded me when i was messing with world editor in Warcraft 3 and i was just spawning 10 same enemies everywhere (when i was 10-11 years old). It got boring because after sometime i just refused to fight most enemies and simple started run past every mob which, again, killed the exploration. This may sounds weird but in a game where, in later areas, i fight the same guy i fought in the beginning area with more hp, it just doesn't make me wanna fight it again. It isn't as bad as Ni Ohs enemy design, but it isn't good either for the scale of the game.Also,  a game so huge is supposed to make  you explore and discover stuff. When it comes to mobs rune drops, they give very few runes (i remember spending like 30 minutes to kill crucible knight in the beginning just to give me 2100 runes!) or the double crucible knight fight that gives you their armor set (WHY DON'T YOU JUST DROP THE ARMOR EARLIER! you kill like 100 of these dudes before and you need to kill them both for their armor?!) which is a bit under-rewarding. I found myself most of the time especially in late game wondering if exploring the X ruins was actually worth it which again, combined with the reused enemies, made me not wanting to explore many areas of the game. The smithing stones are also a little hard to find earlier without proper guides which makes it hard for new players to realise what the hell they are doing wrong and deal no damage which forces you to explore around to find them. Thing is, that this game forces exploration too much. Even items that you need to move on to the game are actually scattered around the world which means you MUST explore everything in order to find them if you don't want to use guides, which is insane cause many people who work like 8 hours a day can't spend that much time just to explore caves and ruins that are identical. This is really so god damn time consuming, i can't remember a previous souls title that put mandatory items into optional areas just to finish the game (i am not talking about starting DLCs).

Quests and NPCS: Not gonna talk a lot about this one because i found it completely insane that i had to search an entire area because the NPC told me ""some bandits stole this thing and they are down the way"" in a huge open world game. And don't get me started on the whole ""handholding"". It has to do with time consuming. If  you need like 10+ hours to finish an entire area with the quests that are so vague, well, it's better not even do them. While some of them were pretty awesome (like Ranni's quest) i did them by using guides because i couldn't spend an entire hour searching for vague statements of the NPCs. Speaking of NPCs, i hated how they didn't even animate them to move or even sync their mouth with that they say. It killed the immersion for me and i wouldn't say it is bad, but it is 2022 game, and this could be done years ago in older games, so i don't think it was THAT hard to animate them. Also i don't like how the whole world moves around you instead moving with you. You must go to the castle morne and meet irina's father in order for the quest to occur? Yeah i know that it is the same in AC games or some other open world games, but nothing happens in this world by itself, you MUST do the X thing in order for the Y thing to happen. It's not like RDR2 for example where some people are building a house and you can spend 20 hours into the game, come back without progressing throught the story and the house is built. I wouldn't mind it but i was expecting something more creative from FS. But since i know how FS works, i can't say that it was that bad. Just a minor nitpick by me.

Builds : the game shines here, 10/10, lots of builds to do, nothing to say here

Bosses : My biggest complain with this game are the boss fights. Not only most of them are designed badly, they are also copy pasted (100 tree sentinels, reusing 2 of the best boss fights in the game for no reason, 100 dragonic tree sentinels, these erdtree spirits etc). To start with, the beginning bosses were actually good, tree sentinel, margit, godrick were amazing bosses. When i first fought Margit i noticed that most of his attacks are delayed to a frustrating point. My first thoughts were like ""ok the boss is slow, so maybe this is why"". But the more i progressed, the more i realised that 99% of the bosses have delayed attacks. Now,  you may claim ""so what, it is a good way for old souls players to enjoy the challenge because  they got gud"". The thing is, they wouldn't git gud if the game was designed  with the same philosophy as the other games. Even people that could streamroll throught DS3 found Gael and Friede hard bosses, not because they had 100 delayed attacks, but because they had complicated attacks. Same goes for Fume Knight and Alonne, same goes for Artorias and Manus. These bosses were good, played at normal speed (a little faster than you but in the same pace of the game) and the fights were like dances. In elden ring however, the bosses are playing a completely different game most of the times and you need to pray to RNG god ""please, make the boss not to use the 10 hit combo with 8 delayed attacks and the 2 fast attacks that can stunlock me and kill me because my iframes aren't enough"". Basically, it is like playing DS2 without ADP. All the attacks can be dodged but the dodge needs to be 100% on point otherwise you will get hit and mostly hit again due to the chain attacks  the bosses have (Malenia's 3 slash attack, Radahn 360 no scope). Also i don't like how the bosses had always an answer for everything. Gap closing, gap opening, 360 attacks, delayed attacks, aoe attacks, insane chain attacks, huge damage, huge hp bar, reacting to drinking  estus, mid range attacks, ranged attacks, insane tracking etc. It felt like they took the AI from the red phantom outside executioner's chariot in DS2 and gave him the delay attacks of Blue Smelter demon in different forms. Most of the bosses felt like that. The issue was much worse when the boss decided  to abuse the RNG in order to kill you. Radahn is a very good example of this. He can summon these orbs that you either need to ride your horse or hide behind the hill to dodge them. Then he can randomly use his starcaller cry which makes  you get damaged because the horse gives no iframes and makes  you getting damaged anyway. And if you hide behind the hill, you won't see Radahn and you can easily get one shot by a random attack. Malenia does the same with the Wateflow attack which becomes next to impossible to dodge if she decides to use in front of you. Or Godfrey with his massive AOE attack that can pull out in random  times, or Radagon's teleport in your face, or Elden Beast summoning the elden stars that can track you forever while it spams huge slashes from a distance (speaking of which, this guy can completely negate the holy damage so if you are running holy build you are screwed in this fight). Also most bosses in second half are probably scaled on ng+ because before MtotG my damage was fine and after i got there my weapons could barely scratch the bosses. I had a feeling that i coudn't control these fights, i can't describe it. Everything happened just for the shake of happening, one shots, rng attacks and combos, huge health bars and insane speed (it took them some patches to realise that UGS are too slow and had to give them a speed buff)... I seriously thought that the game was bugged or something. Let's not speak about the boss quality because if i had to make a list ""top 10 FS games bosses"" the only boss that would maybe made it in the list would be Margit because it was one of the few fights i won because i got gud and not because the RNG outer god helped me. Gank fights were just bad and lame ""throw 2 bosses there and call it a day"" without a single try to balance the fight and make it fun like OaS or Darklurker or Demon Prince or Friede. Bosses like Godskin duo, two Gargoyles, two crucible Knights and many more are literally bland and i have no idea how they got approved. Dungeons, catacombs and ruins bosses were either an NPC acting like a boss or a reused boss in gang fight or a normal enemy with boss hp. But wait, the game gives you spirit ashes to make the fights more managable. Thing is that the ashes are either useless or insanely strong (mimic) so y ou can just relax back and watch your summon obliterating the boss while you are drinking coffee. So you end up in a situation where the boss will be either too difficult or too easy, without the in between.

Then you find another next best thing and discard the former. Till you find the all-powerful-chosen-one-prophecy-sword-of-light-and-gods and that's it. No reason to return back to using any of the lower-tier weapons, keep using the one with the higher numbers.

BOTW tried solving this problem by making everything breakable  (with the exception of the Master Sword), but something about that system really irked a lot of players. Why waste time looking for the next powerful weapon when it breaks like a twig after use?

*Ashes of War* is by far the best design answer to this conundrum. Now the level one crap sword has something the all-powerful sword doesn't: **Customization**. All of Elden Ring's Unique weapons have potent abilities, yes...but you can't swap them out, or change their scaling to suit your build/playstyle.

I always felt annoyed I couldn't change the Skills on Unique Weapons, but I realized that's in place so I can try out something different with the ""less powerful"" weapons. I can experiment with them. They still have some use even when I find something more ""powerful""

After all the horror stories I've read online, I was actually really hyped to see that it would be a straight up duel where, for once, I was allowed to dictate the pace. I had a lot of fun poking at her with my sword, dodging her attacks and overall just trying to keep the pressure up. It felt so satisfying that I didn't even use magic or my shield and instead decided to give her a fair fight by two-handing my stitcher. And then, she used that unholy move and I just couldn't look at that fight the same way. I fought her rather aggressively before, constantly trying to engage and knowing that if I mess up, she's not only gonna deal a lot of damage to me, but she's also gonna heal in the process, so I would be doubly punished for any mistakes. A challenging, but also a fair, fun and engaging system. But after discovering that she can pretty much nuke me if I'm doing anything other than sprinting when she winds up that attack, this fight became a slog. It went from constantly engaging her to trying to bait out her attack and get some damage in if it wasn't waterfowl. This shit annoyed me so much that I genuinely changed my entire build and went from heavy thrusting sword + magic to prelate's charge great stars and literally bullied my way to victory over the rotten bitch with help from my mimic. I'm seriously surprised how only one move can turn an amazing fight into one where I'm scared to do anything riskier because the boss might just decide to cut my ass into hundreds of little pieces without giving me enough time to try and avoid it.","Eldenring",21,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1xjmw/i_hate_the_waterfowl_dance_with_every_fiber_of_my/"

"581","2022-07-18",1658140761,"To my surprise: Using Guard Counter and Spirit Ashes made the game WAY more fun for me.","I will like to ask you some questions:

\-If you were a souls fan at the point of playing Sekiro for the first time, did you at some point had a moment were you thought ""ooooh im supposed to block instead of dashing""?

\-If you didn't play any souls game before playing Sekiro, did that also happened to you?

Im going to assume (for the sake of my argument, basically, this is not a poll after all), that the answers were, for the most part YES for the 1st, and NO for the 2nd.

I had that moment in my **second** playthrough of Elden Ring, using some mechanics that answered lots of the questions I had with the game. If you want to know more about what a random dude on the internet thinks about this, take your time to read (but first, let me apologize for my basic level of english).

\-

I've been playing Souls games since Demon's Souls, at some point in the franchise I decided to stop blocking and started rolling in order to avoid attacks, (except for sekiro, of course) and I never summoned before. **I have the feeling** that what I mentioned is seeing **in general** as the way to play, yes, some of us use shields, some of us summons. But the ""rolling meme"" and people breaking controllers clips are there for a reason.

So when Elden Ring came out, I just did that, I took the ""Open world Dark Souls 4"" approach, and it was fun, for the most part. But something was weird, like something was missing.

What I was missing were mechanics that I now think are essential to Elden Ring: Shield Guard, the joy of summoning spirit ashes and the fun of playing with different tools that the game offers. All of that let me thinking for a while...

We all know how both Bloodborne and Sekiro changed the way we look at how Souls can be played. (well I don't consider Sekiro a souls, actually. But, you know...) BB forced Shield users to dash in order to avoid damage, while Sekiro forced Rolling users to block at the right time.  Lots of us feel naked at the time playing BB for the first time without a shield, and lots of us suffered until we had the ""aha!"" moment in Sekiro. 

After all these months playing and watching many people play, I realize how many frustrations the people that were playing like me had, while the ones taking advantage of those mechanics were having a totally different experience. 

Reading what Critics, Reviewers, Fans and Newcomers have to say about the game, made me realize how different people tend to approach Souls and how different the experience can be. Again: this is based on what I read from others and my own experience, nothing scientific about it and it will not represent everyone. 

So I decided to do a second run from the start and take advantage of things that I was avoiding because *it is not the way I play* **Souls*****.*** I had such a good time! it was fun to learn when to use shield guard or when to just do a regular or heavy attack, bosses gives time to do so. And the Spirit Ashes also creates new openings to attack aswell. I was finally playing **Elden Ring.** 

It is way, way WAY more fun. Yes, some bosses were easier, some were more difficult, actually. I remember rolling my eyes everytime the game gave me a summoning upgrading material as a reward, now I feel like getting a new bigger titanite in past Souls. The amount of creative things we can do with the things that the game offers us to do with different summons, like placing Latenna at the border of the arena to be a turret while you fight the boss, creating different potions to drink according to the boss, breaking the guard of a boss with a shield guard attack. Changing equipment on the go to have a complementary Mimic Tear, etc...

Im happy to finally have my ""aha!"" moment in Elden Ring, but feel sorry that it happened after hundreds of hours. This is more or less what I was trying to say, it changes a lot when you accidentally close the tab at the point of finishing the post. :/

Anyway, if you think otherwise, give it a try, it might surprise you like it did to me. 

what do you think about all this? im allways up for a friendly conversation.

Hoarah Loux
Goldmask
Fia

Gideon Ofnir

Two of them are bosses, and three of them produce mending runes

So why exactly are they brought up? With the two fingers specifically also apparently ""expecting something"" of Gideon, there's clearly some greater importance to them.
Maybe it's contenders to be the Elden Lord? With the Player and Hoarah Loux specifically that would make sense, but Goldmask and Fia are useless in most combat and Dung Eater and Ofnir have resigned themself to mostly ignoring the quest for the throne.

It was pretty standard especially at higher levels when people could afford to have access to them even if they're not spell focused for it to be used, before PvP, bosses, so forth. And with the change where spell slots are determined by key items now, not stats, everyone certainly has room to slot one in.

These spells didn't get weaker btw. How good they were in, say, Dark Souls 3, is how good they are now. They didn't change, but the stuff around them did. Their drop in popularity is likely the direct result of power creep essentially.

"621","2022-07-18",1658125176,"Marias Executioner Sword Underwhelming","First off let me say that for the most part boss weapons tend to be really good. Lot of games when they give you boss weapons, they usually feel watered down toy copies. But in Elden Ring the devs did a really good job of making boss weapons feel really strong and still reflect the unique aspect of each boss. (Expect for a few.) With that said, it is in my opinion that the Marias Executioners Sword is underwhelming. 

The damage scaling is a bit odd with a decent chunk going to magic. This would be fine except that lots of enemies have resistances to magic. The weapon art itself is really good and fun if you build for it. But there are better options for dps that are way safer and more reliable than Eochiads Dancing Blade. Not to mention usually the final swing during the weapon will miss the target which is not great because of how much damage it does. As a side note I could be trippin but sometimes this sword will miss normal follow up attacks and feels pretty short for a great sword. 

This sword feels like one of those watered down boss weapons. I wish the devs gave you the ability to either throw out the drill as your heavy attack or throw out your sword like the bell bearing hunter does with a light attack. (As in heavy and light weapon art attacks) Its not like other weapons dont have 2 unique weapon art abilities. Example of this would be Death Poker or Sword of Night and Flame.

Even after all that I do love this sword and I am still going to use it, just seems like it could be better, not game-breaking, boss-breaking. Just a little better.

TL:DR 

Sword good, wish it had more weapon art abilities. Better swords available. Needs more viability imo.","Eldenring",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1s7sr/marias_executioner_sword_underwhelming/"

I survived the fall and landed near one of the never seen before Godwyn faces and used Horah Loux Remembrance. This action revived him as new boss as part of Those who live in Death questline. Horah Loux escaped and Godwyn's face had changed as well, became alive and gave a few not very clear clues of where to find his other full grown faces. I collected two tiny axolotl like hands from his dead face and woke up.

I've been following along with a number of guides which all have slightly different routes, but all basically follow the same theme;

1. Pick up the Morning Star/Katana/other applicable bleed weapon and a Gold Fowl Foot.
2. Go to Caelid and kill the big mama dragon for the \~100k runes, then grab the Medallion piece.
3. level up INT to 40 and Mind to 20.
4. Grab the Meteorite Staff and Rock Fling from the swamp.
5. Loot the town of Sellia and kill the bosses for Lusat's Staff.
6. Grab the other Medallion piece from Fort Haight, along with as many Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears as you can find.
7. Skip past Stormveil, and run up through Liurnia until you hit the Great Lift. 
8. Run through Altus and Mt Germir until you find Master Azur, and get the Azur Comet spell.
9. Go to the Tree Spirit and kill it for the infinite mana Tear.

One of the differences in all of these guides, is when they say to kill the Crystalians and get the Terra Magicka spell; some say to stop by and do it while running through Liurnia, some say to do it after you've done everything else. But as far as I can tell, from the videos I've seen the only difference is that doing it after means you might have more flasks. And by sheer coincidence, I'm sure, every single mage guide just skips over killing the Crystalians, like it's the easiest thing in the world for a basically INT only caster to do. 

I'm getting my butt handed to me over and over. I don't have the health to tank their hits, I don't have the vigor to wear heavier armor to mitigate their hits, I don't have enough strength to break their armor before they can kill me, and none of my summons are strong enough to keep aggro without also dying immediately.

"741","2022-07-18",1658113766,"Margit/Morgott are Probably my Favorite Bosses in Soulsgames","So let me just start off by saying this.

Before Elden Ring I considered myself to be a slightly experienced Souls newbie. My first souls game was DS2 (3 had long been out but 2 was the only one my laptop could run, and I had heard bad things about  the DS remaster).

Well 2 was a... rough experience. I'm sure there are people that like it and that's great! But Personally it just didn't feel great for me for a variety of reasons that I don't want to get off topic dweelling on. Eventually I got a better computer and abandoned DS2 for DS3 and stopped playing (started a long break) after defeating Abyss Watchers.

But in my days of DS2 and 3 I kept some embarrisingly major bad habits. Panic Rolling during fights, Being scared of dying out of the curse thing and losing souls to a point where I had reset areas an insanely ridiculous number of times before finally making it out of the area, being absolutely TERRIBLE at PvP (mostly because of panic roll).

Despite getting a tiny bit better about panic rolling and being braver, souls games at the time just never felt meant to click for me. And so began my very long break from playing them after defeating abyss watchers (which was an absolutely amazing fight. Like I said not dissing on the games, just at the time felt too hard for me).

And then eventually Elden Ring came out.

Now, I was hesitant on buying the game, particularly for the reasons stated above on me being aweful at souls games. But, I was looking for a new RPG, my friends were all getting it, the world looked beautiful, reviewers gave the game all perfect scores, magic in this game looked PHENOMENAL (I always wanted to play a spellcaster but i stuck with knight in the DS games for armor and vigor).

So I bought the game the moment it launched, started as astrologer, fought tree sentinal horse guy at the beginning (mistakes were made), and eventually made it to a boss I had heard a lot about at the time.

Margitt the Fell Omen.

At the time, I absolutely hated the boss. I had tried, and tried, and tried, and tried over and over, for exaccty 3 hours straight. I used all of my spells, whatever summons I had, summoned Rogier every single time, only to die over and over and over again.

But little did I realize at the time Margit was erasing my every bad habit, and unironically being the perfect trainer. The delayed attacks made me have to pay attention to his timing, rather than guess rolling and panic rolling I truly relied on reflexes. Dying to him over and over again for 3 hours practically erased my fear of death and rune loss completely, I was never again afraid to try and try again untill success.

And boy was that success sweet.

After 3 long hours of abusing the HELL out of summons, I finally beat him, and it was such an amazing feeling.

Well time goes on, i get better/stronger and progress, and much to my surprise we meet again.

So began my battle with Morgott the Omen King.

And it was special to me really. When I first fought Margit, all I did was panic roll. When I fought woth Morgott, my dodges were perfectly timed (well, mostly lol). When I fought Margit, I absolutely abused my spirit summons and summoning Rogier. When I fought Morgott, I used 0 summons. When I fought Margit, it took me 3 hours.

When I fought Morgott, it took me 20 minutes.

After talking to him one last time, I just felt, amazing really. That moment in my defeating Morgott made me realize just how much better I had gotten, how far I had come since being told I had absolutely 0 maidens.

But really, the feeling was indescribable. And I will never forget my battle with Margit the Fell, and Morgott the Omen King.

Elden Ring has absolutely become my favorite game of all time. Still working on beating it, as I really just play whenever I have time and enough energy to focus, but man it has been one hell of a journey so far.


Just wanted to share my personal take. Sorry for the text wall but I appreciate you for taking the time to read about my experience.

I'm in love with the weapons I have on elden ring and I want to enjoy pvp.     Here is my issue:

(Edit: my deaths poker has been very buggy)
I use the worst weapon in the game for pvp, the deaths poker, and if I even want a fight from a person I get locked out of one of my weapons and I really never like switching my class up at least just for my reaper 


Biggest issue is I want to have more fair fights where we are like 2 bosses but half the time I'm getting spammed by the same skills or attacks or magic 

I don't play like these maidenless with there spams. 





But really why is every fight fought without respect I feel.     Maybe I've been unlucky","Eldenring",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1kyd9/im_a_really_good_souls_player_but_my_builds_suck/"

Was just fighting Loretta in the Haligtree, and had something weird happen. I had entered with a bunch of souls, knowing it looked like a boss room, and there was a chance I would fuck up at some point and not retrieve them. Died once, got back, and picked up the runes pretty much on the same frame as I got hit by a small attack. This caused the runes to just straight up disappear. I guess it's not the biggest issue, having such a thing happen once in 150 hours, but it still sucked! Couldn't really find anything about it, so no clue if that is exactly what happened, or if it's possible to replicate anywhere, or if it had something to do with the area","Eldenring",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/w1ko2h/corpse_runes_disappear_on_pickup/"

After a turbulent few months I can officially say that after 157h 43m I have completed Elden Ring! (some many of these hours may or may not have been staring blankly at the screen after getting my behind handed to me for the 12883th time or googling the weaknesses of bosses but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do) 

I have collected all the great runes, done as many questlines as I could, catacombs, followed things you missed videos AND got the Age of Stars ending as a fromsoftware noob!!

Now I know that rumour has it Elden Ring may not have been as difficult as previous titles in the fromsoftware collection and I never thought I'd like a 'hard' game but honestly I was totally immersed in the lore, I felt so accomplished after beating difficult bosses and I am genuinely looking at other games like bloodbourne or sekiro as my next challenge (after new game + ofcourse!) but I just had to share with you guys how proud I am for managing this feat and becoming Elden Lord!

I also have a nack for finding secrets and hidden things and by god did this game have me itching to explore each and every area.. To then go back and find things I previously missed AND THEN watch a things you missed video and finding even more!

I guess I wanted to say thanks to you guys aswell for your words of wisdom, I may not be an active poster but trust me when I say your tips and tricks helped massively as I traversed through the game!! (also massive thanks to my hubby who spoon-fed me plenty info and spent many hours watching and rooting for me as I fought many foe and became Elden Lord!! 

Also if you recommend grabbing any particular item or doing anything before hitting new game+ please let me know as I will be spending a couple hours on cleanup before I go into the story all over again (thankfully with more understanding than the first time!)


Anyway, Tarnished.. Thank you for letting me brag, and making it this far in the post &amp; bring on the platinum!

What was going down as my GOAT game will prob get top 20/honorable mentions for me personally due to to end of the game being locked behind a fight that I will gladly experience again.  

So to end my drunken and incoherent rant.  I **hate** the Godskin Duo fight more than I *love* Elden Ring as a hell.  Like a great movie ruined by a shitty ending.
